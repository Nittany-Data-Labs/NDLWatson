My mom went to a funeral of his lover and was telling me how his body was cold and frozen :(.
She said that it made her sad seeing him like this for the last time.
I often think about death since my friend (who I have feelings for) had a crash.
In the back of my mind, I want to end this “friendship” because I wouldn’t like to receive the news that he passed away.
He’s over there (Canada) and me over here (USA).
Since I’m illegal, it will be impossible for me to visit him there :'(.
The idea of his death, tears me apart when I think about it.
I don’t like this.
I hate death and most of it, the fucking distance!!
!
