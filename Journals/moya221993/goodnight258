Everytime he gives me suggestion on how to pursuit men I meet, it makes me sad to know that he doesn’t get jealous anymore.
I wish he could tell me things that indicate he still interested in me but since he met other girl 11 months back, I’m defeated.......there’s nothing I can do about it anymore....
I still wonder what does she has that I don’t have 
I often scare to tell him, what do you like about her or what made her interesting that you decided to met her and still being with her even if she sucks so often
