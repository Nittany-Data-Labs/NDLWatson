I finished watching Turbo Kid with my “friend”, Michaël.
I was surprised how I love this funny quirky movie!
He recommended for us to watch it but I was highly skeptical of his choice because sci-fi comedy is not really my thing.
I was wrong :).
Just some minutes ago, we talked about it and told each others goodnight.
For tonight, I’m a happy girl even if I felt some sort of shitty hours ago.
He knows how to make me feel definitely better and the fact that he was smiling because I wanted to watch a movie with him is priceless.
Our days together will be over in 2 weeks because he will return to work at nights everyday after a car crash that left him temporarily injured.
I’m glad he’s alive and he’s feeling better each day 😀 <3
