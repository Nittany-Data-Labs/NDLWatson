It’s been almost a week and a half and I still don’t get a job.
No calls, no interviews, nothing..it makes me sad because the another year will pass and I still will be a fucking loser.
I’m out options for now.
Studying for the GED is really hard because I often lazy and get sleep halfway through and end up studying for only 30 mins.
Right now, I could had study but I’m not or hours ago but I didn’t.
I still lack so much motivation as well as to lose weight!!
I’m often scare of the future because I’m wasting it huge and I don’t know what to do.
I just don’t want to have anymore mistakes nor regrets.
I’m lost...At 22, I should know what to do in my fucking life, to have my shit on..( in my opinion ).
I’m not complaining, I’m reviewing my own thoughts.
That’s all
I hate how life is complicated lol
