Second day is already more exhausting than day 1 because the lady who is training me expects me to learn already the entire drill!.
I couldn’t hold it and told her that I won’t learn everything in 2 days, shit..drove me mad already and all morning to noon, had done nothing but to told me how I fucked the beds, and how I need to fucking hurry up!.
Me, kept telling her back and to be honest I won’t put up with her attitude.
Just because I’m illegal, I won’t let anyone to treat me “bad” at work or to make me feel less!
For day 2, I already memorize how to clean the bathrooms, clean the furniture, and vacuum the room.
The only issues I have is how to do the bed and the color coding list of rooms that I have to do bed or not, and which bed sheets to grab.
oh, also how to be much faster and get less tired.
I highly don’t  recommend hotels to anyone, especially if its less than 3.5 rating
 
Reasons why: (about my hotel)
Poor hygiene
The people who are staying for more than 2 days, they get dirty bed sheets.
Pillows are so dirty from inside the pillow covers.
No gloves when cleaning
Lack of staff
Poor hotel sanitary overall
Old furnitures
*2 days and this job is so exhausting that I want to quit
