Whenever my friend mentions his lover, I wish I could had a lover to stop feeling jealous all the time..
I often get sad when I see pics of naked couples around tumblr or love scenes  because I imagine my friend and her together 
 
Itâ€™s hard to move on by I will because it makes me sick to cry for some stupid crush shit
