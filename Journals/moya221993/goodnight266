On Friday, my mom’s lover died and I feel bad because I often talked bad about him with my sister judging him by the way he looked and his job.
It was a very shocking news to me because it was one of the things I never expected and mom was beyond devastated, she’s doing alright but it will take her time to heal though.
I’m there to help whenever I can and what she needs.
On Monday, I got a called from another job that I had applied and told me to go on Tuesday (Wings fast food restaurant) and I didn’t like it.
I felt very pressure when both men who were teaching left me alone there, trying to do about 8-10 orders by myself that I didn’t know how to do them :(.
Overwhelm by the ladies upfront asking me to “hurry” and I just took off my apron and told another worker to let me go out.
I lasted working there for 4.5 hours.
Then, a lady worker and the boss came to ask me what had happened.
I told them that It became too much and my feet hurt very bad :(.
They talked me through how I shouldn’t feel down and told me I could comeback tomorrow (today).
I decided not to, I feel embarrass to go back again.
The same day (Monday), I got paid for the first time!!!
It feels so good to have money in my wallet 😀
Last Week, there’s a man who caught my eyes last week at work (hotel) and he’s very hot, gorgeous.
Well, actually never seen him but I just remembering that I have been cleaning his room but just saw him some days ago (face and everything).
My problem is that I don’t know how to make him notice or how to “talk” to him lol.
I think he wouldn’t be attracted to a housekeeper like me and to be honest, I’m not that pretty either :P. I fantasize about him sexually.
It would be nice to enter his room and fuck him like seriously though.
I want a man/men but I don’t know how to, I only want it to take the stress away of life...
