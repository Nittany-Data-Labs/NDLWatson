Two cities I lived n have lived.
Just thought it’s kind of funny to watch the game  today was really hot here in chicago almost 100 degrees.
Tried to run after work at the lake barely make half way n had to walk back cause of hot weather made me extra tired.
I was gonna buy a domain n setup the site but decided to do it later since I don’t have everything ready yet.
Getting hungry again ahhh..
