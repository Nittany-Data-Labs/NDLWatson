the first day of new design on GoodnightJournal.com.
I had to keep on my eyes on the site constantly today to see everything works good!
Been making some changes as I see things.
So far so good!
Hope you like it.
it was a very typical day.
Work 10 to 6 but no gym today cause I got lazy.
Got back home around 7 and went out with Linda for dinner and some desert at Mariano’s.
Had to wait till 10:30 to pick up my friend from Korea.
Finally picked him up at blue line station and got home little after 11.
Did some taking with him n just took a shower.
It’s 12:20 AM now and I’m so ready to go to bed.
I kind of have been thinking about the new design all day and really hope it will work better for everyone here.
