started working on this site.
updated latest version of WP and trying to see what I can do with calendar navigation error and deactivate option for each users.
I was actually gonna start work on it today but I failed because I still need to get more stuffs for my apartment.
Had to go to Ikea for my bed frame when I could get a ride with my friend’s van and had to built it myself.
After that, my relatives came over for dinner.
One thing we try to do once in a month.
Now, I’m sitting at the desk start thinking about solutions for those issues.....
