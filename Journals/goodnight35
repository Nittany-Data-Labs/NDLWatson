That’s a Bible verse.
I helped out a bit when he needed money, and came by asking for work.
I over paid him, because his need seemed so great.
Since then he has come asking for more money.
I’m afraid I’m an easy touch, and don’t make wise decision.
We’re on limited income ourselves.
God, help me know the right things to do.
