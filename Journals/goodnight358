Typical day.
Just work and home.
Work out on the lunch break and back pain from yesterday.
Kind if annoyed me all day.
Especially when I had to seat down for work and driving.
Quick grocery shopping for dinner.
John is out from Monday and be out for couple more days.
After the dinner and shower, I had time to seat down(actually laid down lol) organize things.
Paid all my bills, went throught the sites, quuck search on the trip.
My vacation approved today and now I need to book a flight ticket and hotel.
I wanna get away from here little bit but don’t want to spend too much money.
Try to get everything done under 1k.
Well it’s 10PM now and trying to see what I’m gonna do for rest of the night.
