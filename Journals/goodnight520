Just got home and took a shower from helping John moving.
Since we both work all day, we had to start after 7 PM and it took about 4 hours to finish.
It was raining all the time we were moving anyways it’s done now and I’m ready to sleep.
One notice, since we are getting too many spams on the site, I decided to install anti-spam plugin on site.
it should not happen but just in case if you have a problem with login or logout please let me know.
have a goodnight!
