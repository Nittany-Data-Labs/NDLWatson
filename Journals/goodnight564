this site was down for 2 days.
I contacted godaddy over 10 times to make this process faster but it’s still not done yet.
I’m aware of the uploading image issue but I can’t really do anything till they completely done with migrating to new server.
I never really have any problem with them so far but this process is really frustrating.
they said it will be done by 4PM  tmw by central time so hopefully it fixes the issue of uploading images.
I am apologize for the inconvenience.
