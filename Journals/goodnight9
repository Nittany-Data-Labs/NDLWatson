Yesterday (March 13) was my dad’s birthday.
He died several years ago.
I didn’t feel sad on his birthday.
I don’t miss him.
Our relationship was kind of aborted in my early childhood.
I missed him THEN.
But when I met him as an adult it was complicated and uneasy.
It has all been healed by Jesus Christ’s mercy, and instead of grief or resentment or anything else there is only peace in that part of my life now.
Beautiful peace.
Thank you, Lord.
