Finnally got to try the korean restaurant that I always wanted try.
Itâ€™s not the traditional korean food but I really liked what I had today as it shown on the picture.
I tried kalbi, pork, & shrimp taco with kimchi fries.
I Really liked all of them n I will definitely go again for those tacos  
Maybe oneday, I will have my own korean restaurant that I always dreamed of.
I went out last night n got little bit of  hang over in the morning.
Worked on new project all day till my friend came over for late lunch at korean restaurant in lakeview.
Having a very relaxing day off.
