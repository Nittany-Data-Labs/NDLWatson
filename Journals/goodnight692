Finally fell a sleep around 10am n passed out all day.
Still feel sick cant tell that Iâ€™m getting better or not.
Had a dinner appointment with my friends so I had to get off from the bed.
Normally I would cancel it but today I kind of had to go.
Had Italian food which made me feel little better n drove back to home with some boxes to pack my stuffs.
All I want right now is just go to sleep n hopefully get better when I wake up tmw.
