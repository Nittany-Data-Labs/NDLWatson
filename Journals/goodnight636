I’m so sorry for the bug I had for past hour.
I updated site and it got me some bugs.
Now it’s all GOOD.
Please let me know if you find any bugs or something does not work properly.
I’m constantly keeping eyes on this site but sometimes, I met a limitation of managing the site by myself such as finding a bug.
Please help me out to keep this site running properly.
I apologize again for inconvenience.
As I said before, I will try as hard as I could to keep this site safe and running good as it intended.
