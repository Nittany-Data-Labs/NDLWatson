Today I go with my mom to look at caskets.
This was her idea.
She’s 92 and has some health issues, and she wants to get everything “ready” so it won’t be a burden on my sister and me.
Bless her heart.
She is always thinking of others, not herself.
There was a time we had trouble getting along (happens in almost every family, doesn’t it?
)  But for years now I have seen what a stellar person she is and a doting mother and grandmother.
I am SO thankful to God that He melted any foolish resentment that used to be in my young heart.
I love my mom SO much now, for years.
I can’t imagine life without her.
She keeps trying to prepare me.
She’ll say “I can’t last forever.”  I tell her, “Try, please.” So she tries by exercising and eating broccoli and other good food and taking vitamins and her medicines.
She is truly wonderful.
I hope I don’t make a fool of myself and cry at the mortuary.
I want to help her pick out the casket because she wants just the cheapest thing they have and my sister and I want something pretty and soft and white.
Think about me around 10:30 if you read this.
A prayer would be so appreciated.
