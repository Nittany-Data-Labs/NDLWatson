It’s been an hour that I’m trying to go to sleep but failed.
I hate when it happens.
I took a nap earlier today and that’s probably why I’m having trouble going sleep now.
I want a deep and nice sleep!!
It’s been a long day today.
Got drunk at middle of the day with Carolina.
We started drinking around 2 PM and passed out till 8:30 PM lol had to go Chandlers 21st birthday party after that.
Couldn’t really stay long cause I felt too tired.
Then I can’t go to sleep now... 
Couple of late night thoughts.
– no more smoking
– cut down drinking
– more workout
– sleep early and wake up early
I’m not going to go hard on my for theses things but I think I really need to start doing these things it’s really the time to take care of myself.
Yes, you can do this!!
2 AM on Sunday(now it is).
