Well, I have been writing journals for over 6 years and I still encounter a day that I have no idea what to write.
Apparently, today is the day.
lol For this matter, I just gonna write about things I did today.
I woke up around 10 AM and went to church.
After the worship, we had this little thing that exchanging a Christmas gift kind of like secret santa I guess.
I brought a Startbucks  gift card and I ended up getting Starbucks instant coffee and cup for my Christmas gift.
funny.
Back home, work out at gym for about an hour & working on this site.
ok thatâ€™s pretty much it for today.
