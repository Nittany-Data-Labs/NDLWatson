It has been 4 days since I started working and I’m completely dead all day.
I have understood 70% of the duties that I have to do daily and I want to quit so bad already.
Cleaning rooms is the most unpleasant thing!!!
The bad thing is that guests like me because I’m the only one who can speak fully English and I literally a miracle.
A guy gave me $5 to clean all his room when today I was only supposed to take the trash and add additional towels, good thing tho :).
My mom tells me that even if I quit this job, every single job is exhausting anyways.
Tomorrow, it will be one of the  busiest day and I don’t wanna go :(.
I feel like I haven’t talk to my friend, Michael in a longtime (only 2 days) and I hope we can watch a movie tonight because I miss him all the time.
I hate that I like him alot :(, what can I do!?!?
he is just too nice to me and so kind, I’m overwhelm *-*
