On Sundays, whenever possible, my mom (age 92) and I go visit local nursing homes and I play hymns for them to sing.
I play “Old time favorites” like Love Lifted me, I’ll fly Away, I’ve got a Mansion, —-things you’ve probably never heard of.
Old hymns.
They like those best.
Today someone made announcement that Hazel died yesterday, a large black woman who loved to sing with us.
She had been too sick to join us for a long while.
But her favorite hymn was Jesus Loves Me, so we sang that in her honor.
That was my Sunday.
Besides that Matthew (age 14) lay in the floor at church using my jacket for a pillow and slept for about 45 minutes in church today.
(smile)  Life is good.
