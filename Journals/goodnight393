We got 30 people came out for skating last night and it was really fun.
The weather was perfect and the city was beautiful.
I’m glad that this group is becoming more attractive to more people and more people get to have fun with us.
It’s 1:10 PM, just had brunch myself and about to start my day.
Have a plan at night and don’t really have anything before that.
probably go out for biking or something.
Have a great weekend everyone!
