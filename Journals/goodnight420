Maybe I have been trying to hide my real feelings.
Pretend to be happy all the time try to hide my weaknesses.
In fact that today I felt very depressed by no reason.
Just had same typical day but by the time when I got home I become all emotional all the sudden.
My cousin told me its coming from the weight loose thing that I’m doing (no food after 6pm) but I don’t thing that’s the reason but still have no idea why.
This happens quite amount of times lately.
I feel like I need to do something but don’t know what.
I just wanna fell asleep for now.
