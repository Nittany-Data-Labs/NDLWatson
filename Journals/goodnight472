Dear diary, I had very busy day at work.
I spent most of day working on new design on the site that has about 10,000 pages of content.
I actually have had a new design from 6 month ago but it never got implemented on the site.
Today, I did improve the design and coded that design into actually website.
Since the site has tons of content and has not been updated for years, I needed to be really careful to make sure everything works good with new design and code.
I think I got about 80% done today and hopefully we can push the site within this week or earlier next week.
Well the bottom line is I had fun to working on that site.
Now I got home 3 hours ago, ate my ass off, took a shower and sitting at my computer thinking about my new project.
Trying to think what to do first...
