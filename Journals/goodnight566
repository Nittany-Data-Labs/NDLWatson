Feel like I’m missing something or empty.
Weird feeling I don’t really like it just making me nervous little.
Working, gym on lunch break (swam for today caused by hot weather), practicing speaking, laundry, BBQ chicken.
Yeah that’s pretty much it ohh and still tired little bit lol.
Read script almost 100 times now.
Still not good enough but definetly getting better.
Hope this thing works out well.
I’m not afraid to success or fail
