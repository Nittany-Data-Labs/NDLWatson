Writing a quick diary for today before I start working on freelance projects.
Today, I got like 5 mins late at work cause I spent too much time getting ready lol.
Work was okay not that busy but got decent amount of work to spend a day.
Worked out with Peter again on the lunch break.
Drove right back to home after work.
John wasn’t at home as usual.
It seems to me he really busy everyday for doing stuffs but does not spend enough time for himself.
I wish he invests more time on his future.
Anyways, went out for running about an hour, took a shower and about to start my second part of the day.
Yup, my life is nothing exciting and that’s why I keep try to make it exciting.
Well if that makes sense lol.
