got my third cold in this year.
I don’t know why I keep getting cold.
It usually comes once or twice in years but some reason I got third one already this year lol.
I’m feeling better today tho hopefully I get this over by tmw so I don’t have to suffer at work.
the weather is so nice today but I’m just staying home n being lazy all day.
