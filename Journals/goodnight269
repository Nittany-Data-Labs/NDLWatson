After a long late night yesterday, I woke up and it was so boring like plain boring today.
OMG, I just want to this day get over and fucking sleep!!!
I forgot to mention that I love my late Christmas gift from my friend, Michael.
I got 2 PostSecret books on Friday (yesterday) but the funny thing is that he gave me the first edition that I already own (never told him about it).
I wondered, out of the 6-7 books why he chose that one lol?!?!?!
I was about to tell him that but you know what?
I won’t because I plan to sell the book that I bought and keep the one he gave me :).
Finally,  we spent the rest of the night watching hockey, a movie, and telling each other goodnights.
He’s such a nice man, friend that I’m very lucky to have him and I don’t want to be away from him anymore.
If I were capable of having a bf, it would be him without a doubt..
