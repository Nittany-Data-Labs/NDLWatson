I believe it’s very important to keep your promises.
some people just keep breaking promises like nothing and insist they didn’t do anything wrong.
that’s just so wrong it means they don’t respect others at all.
hope people know that it’s very important to make a promises then actually keeping it because you should not make a promises if you can’t keep it.
I understand there are some circumstances that you can’t keep it.
However, you can’t let that happen over and over again.
you will just become a faithless person if you do that.
how about start with saying sorry when you couldn’t keep the promises you made instead of saying bullshits.
