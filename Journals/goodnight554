I don’t really have nothing to write about.
just one of very typical day.
work, gym on lunch break, and running by the lake after work.
Weather definitely got cool down which gave me better condition to run for an hour.
I noticed today that footer social media section that I fixed last night resulted a weird page load.
Assuming that was causing by facebook like button.
So I fixed back to what it was and removed send button since it does not seem to be necessary to have.
now it’s time to work on parkMartini!
enjoy journaling!
