I fell asleep while I was watching movie at my apartment.
woke up around 11:00 AM; spent almost 3 hours to clean up my apartment.
it feels so refresh for being in my apartment now.
there is construction on train rail right behind my building that completely blocked my parking lot entrance so I canâ€™t use my car today.
I will just go get a new battery on my watch and walk around little bit.
Have a Good Weekend Everyone!!!
