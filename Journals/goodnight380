It was very quiet Monday at work.
Did not have a lot going on and many people were still on the break or something.
Just did the things that I normally do.
work out on lunch break which made me feel good and energetic for rest of the day.
Despite the nice weather, I did not go out to lake to run or skate after work.
instead I had huge dinner myself cause I felt lazy lol and I felt I need some rest for my body to recover from last week’s stress.
Bought glasses from online, paid bills, watched a soap opera that I like.
It’s 10:40 PM now on my bed writing diary for today.
Probably go to sleep soon after this.
Hope all of you had a good starting of the week!
