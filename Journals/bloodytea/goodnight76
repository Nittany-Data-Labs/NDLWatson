     I took a bit of the sun.
Surprisingly Is wasnâ€™t as hot as one would think.
delectable
scrumptious
I am chlorophyll
Organs thrive
MY organs thrive
Release and consume.
I am honey I am pollen
Pulling and drawing
breathing,
 scream at the cut
healing  from the blade,
I have eaten the Sun,
I gave it back
Again.
