     How strange, someone has wrote in my journal.
You would think I would be mad but Iâ€™m not.
In a way its interesting and creepy all at the same time.
I thought about changing my password but you know what?
I am not going to.
I sorta liked the excitement.
Feel fee to write in my journal again who ever you are.
