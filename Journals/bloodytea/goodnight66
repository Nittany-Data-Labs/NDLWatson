    The truth is I am okay.
I may not feel like it most of the time as of lately but I am okay.
I have been through hell and back and Here I am I am still here.
I may be damaged but I will heal.
I am okay.
I have water, a house, heat, and lights.
I have a car to drive.
I have my art and my music.
Most of all I have my two beautiful perfect children and I have my mother who loves me deeply.
I am okay.
.
Perhaps I have screwed up more  than once but we all have and I am only human.
I have to look at the facts rationally.
I am a great mother.
I am a good honest person.
This is my life and I do not need to throw pearl before swine hoping the swine will turn to gold.
I have no need to dwell over what I can not change.
I can change my self, I can control my self.
I can make good healthy choices for my family and I. I can try my best and when I make a mistake I can pick my self up and brush my self off and learn for the next time.
I am strong and I am worth a lot more then I allow my self to have.
It is time for me to be brave and start giving my self what I deserve.
I do not deserve abuse or to be put down and called names.
I do not deserve to be screamed at or hit.
I do not deserve to be walked all over and used.
I do deserve the be treated kindly and loved.
I am worth having nice things.
I do deserve happiness and comfort.
I am okay and I am worth a lot.
