    Your halos getting heavy.
You can paint your lead balloon white still it will not stop sinking.
Onto the graves you dug that caused no grief.
A stubborn wave.
A heartless grin over sized and under played so well.
You have surly caught my eye.
Ringing satisfaction like a diamond on a band.
ignorance for the price of forever.
Donâ€™t stop to care.
Stop to think and smirk to your dead.
There is no burden that you carry.
The guiltless of the guilty.
