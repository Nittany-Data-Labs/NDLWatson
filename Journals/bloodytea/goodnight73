     Smack, Brown bug did it.
Laugh, how cute.
Blushing....,
thoughts, really I didnâ€™t do it, brown did it.
summertime lemonade shared
shoe box homes made with love.
Ages takes hold,
Adults hiding a secret one questions enough not to tell
still not enough to admit what may not be true
he is real he is real I know it I can hear him still
quiet but there
invisible but there
seen by the little blond girl
seen by the dark haired woman.
Brown Bug, I still love you and I still believe.
