Seraphric affection,
Rogue Sovereign,
For who I have marked time loyally before your coming.
Upon arrival of you particular lure.
Madcapped benevolence swept though this vessel.
Electric regards  for my knight fell apace.
Oh how all Gods in heaven shall never dissever our hearts that bind beyond time and space.
