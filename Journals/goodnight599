So first day driving my car to work.
drove to work with my co-workers who gave me a ride for over a week.
everything went ok till when we came out for lunch.
I tried to start my car but it didn’t start.
couldn’t believe that my car that I bought last night got broke.
had to call Toyota road assistance to get jump on my car.
it was really frustrating that I’m keep getting problems on the car.
stopped by at Chicago Northside Toyota and got a new battery on my car that I bought last night lol.
plz no more car stuffs!!
!
