I feel lost lately.
I didn’t really do much just work and home for past couple weeks.
Lost lots of motivation and became very lazy.
Failed to utilize my free time productively.
I’m thinking back right now and this got me realize that I didn’t really do anything productive at all lately lol.
I always wanted to be lazy at home.
Now I remember that I did not even want to go out after work cause I felt lazy.
Yes this has to change.
I been always thinking tho that I want to do my own thing.
Always trying to get some ideas that I can put my passion into.
O don’t rush and open your mind more widely.
It will come to you if you keep looking for it!
