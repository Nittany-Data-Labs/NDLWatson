As a child and young adult, I never slowed down enough to realize the biggest pressing matter which would inevitably consume me whole.
I would be utterly powerless in its grasp.
Despite having relatives and even a good friend pass on it didn’t occur to me, that I too will one day be no more.
When my belly was swollen and full with unborn life getting ready to make its grand entrance, it hit me hard like a stone wall.
This life in me came from seemingly no where.
Sure, I know the scientific process and all that... but think about one moment I am me, next I am a creator.
As easily as my sweet babe can enter this world, her exit could be faster.
If she can go.
I can go.
Finally my mortality terrified me.
Awake in the night, I tried not to cry.
Crippling panic weld up inside me.
It took a few years, but I’ve made my peace.
I no longer worry about this absolute fact.
No matter what I do, I can not stop it.
So I go on.
I live my life.
I love my life.
It’s precious to me.
I take the time to value myself, my family, and everything that makes me smile.
It’s amazing and I will take the time to enjoy it until the very end.
