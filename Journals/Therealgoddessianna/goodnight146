I really don’t have that much to say tonight, I think.
Work seems to be getting better.
Sure, it’ll have it’s ups and downs, but that’s just how life goes.
No such thing as a perfect barrel of apples, right?
All in all, I like it.
I will adjust.
I will adapt.
I will strive to succeed.
The soda free year is still in gear.
I can’t believe I’m passing up soda.
I’m positive such a small (and yet huge to me) change will really benefit me in the long run.
No more am I guzzling caffeinated, artificially colored, fizzy, liquid sugar.
Now would be a good time to mention that not only am I slimming down my waist line, but I’m improving my skin.
Once no soda becomes the no thought involved norm for me, I should figure out the next bad habit to give up... baby steps.
My diet has been more nutritionally substantial too.
Today’s lunch was spring mix, baby kale, onions, apples with balsamic vinaigrette drizzled on top.
Dinner was spaghetti, but the pasta was whole wheat.
My baby has really been supportive in all of this, although he keeps making it a point to say he enjoys the new curves.
On a side note, the kids go back to school tomorrow.
They are less than thrilled.
