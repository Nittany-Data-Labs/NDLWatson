This week has been pretty good.
Thursday was my day off.
Went to the city with The Man.
We walked around the mall for awhile.
I bought myself and The Man coordinated necklaces (mine’s a pentagram inside a circle with the zodiac signs enscribed on the stainless steel).
The Man’s necklace is a pentagram too, but it’s darker than mine.
While we were looking at jewelry I spotted a tee shirt with a kitten puking a rainbow.
It screamed Deedee so I got it for her.
She’s wearing it as I write this blog...
Yesterday was Snoochie’s play “The Elephant Child”.
I loved going to her school and watching her sing.
After the performance The Man and I went to Bojangles (best biscuits EVER).
Then we went to the store and got Snoochie a giant stuffed tiger and 2 shirts.
I couldn’t wait til she got home to surprise her.
I worked last night and it was a big boss shift.
It was actually a very pleasant, smooth evening.
It’s awesome when Big Boss is in a good mood.
So that’s been my weekend so far and all in all, it’s been good!
