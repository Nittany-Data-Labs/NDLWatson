I’ve been growing aware of it since I’ve settled into the south and my new house.
I never dreamed something so petty would irk me so much... but I’m skinny with a gut.
Not working and consuming way too much junk food is really taking its toll on my body.
So now that I’ve identified the problem, I can either correct it or start buying bigger pants.
To be honest, I don’t want to accept this as the new me.
New Years seems like a good time to lay down a resolution.
After January 1st, I think it’s time to say good bye to soda and the rest of junk food I so love.
I’d also like to work out a bit more.
