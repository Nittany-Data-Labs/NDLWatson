So I started again working on new design for GoodnightJournal today.
Well I have been thinking about it for months and actually took a first step couple weeks ago but I have been kind of busy lately and did not have time to work on it.
Today, I got some time to go back and restart where I stopped.
I actually got some progress today and it got me very excited.
It will have much simple interface which will make writing way easier.
Got my new font selected and got main layout done almost!
Just little worry about the new functions that I want to implement on new design.
Hopefully it won’t take that long.
It will still need some time for me to launch it but I just can’t wait to talk about it!
Can’t wait to show it to everyone!
I just gotta work my ass off
