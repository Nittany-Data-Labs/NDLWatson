I went to gym for swimming.
after the swimming, I got back to my locker and tried to open my lock and realized that I forgot the password.
I haven’t used it for about a month but still just can’t believe that I forgot the password.
tried to open it many times but couldn’t get it open ended up cut it off.
Am I losing my brain cells?
couple days ago, I passed out while I was drinking and could remember anything... Y is this happening to me?
lol Later today, I talked about this with Heather and she told me the password which is 23 25 3.
Anyways, I need a new lock.
