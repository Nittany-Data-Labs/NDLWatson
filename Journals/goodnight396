cause I went sleep early last night?
I got up at 4:30 AM now I’m fully awake lol I went bed kind of early last night probably around 11:00 PM cause I have a doctor’s appointment in the morning at 9 AM.
However, I did not expect to be up this early.
Since that happened, I decided to enjoy the time.
So I watched the game of throne on the bed and now I’m writing an early journal.
It just passed 6 AM here so the grocery store right cross over the street should be open by now.
I just have to decide what I want to eat for breakfast.
Today, I have to get ready by 8:20 AM, stop by at doctor’s office for my ear, then work, and skating after work.
I don’t know how the weather will be tonight.
I think it will still go unless it rains but one thing we know it will be cold tonight.
I will drive to downtown after work and see how long it takes to get there hopefully not too long.
Have a great Friday everyone!
YES it is Friday
