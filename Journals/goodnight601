So cop called on Sunday n noticed me that they found my car.
I went to the location that they told me n saw whoever stole my car took out all the parts n just abandoned body on the street.
There were that much I could do except for just junk it.
Never thought this would happen to me but apparently it did.
Had to say goodbye to my car that I drove around all over the place for like 6 years.
