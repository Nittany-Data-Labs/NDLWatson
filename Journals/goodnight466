Yay my weekend starts today.
Just got home from work and I don’t have to go to work till next monday cause I got thursday n friday off.
I dont really have any plans, had to use my PTO otherwise it just gonna go away.
Feels good to be having a long weekend except for one thing that I’m in middle of the project that I’m really excited about.
I got pretty much done today n I will probably finish up tmw at home.
If I don’t do that tmw , I know it will bugs me all the time for like 4 days.
All I have to do is apply new design n check everything works ok.
Yes I can totally sacrify couple hours for that.
Tonight, I’m gonna have some drinks with my friends.
There were traffics from yahoo today.
I don’t really know what’s going on yet.. we will see.
Have a good night everyone!
