goodnight252,I just found some days ago but I decided to listen to it just now lol.
goodnight252,The song is called, Stella Gemella by Eros Ramazzotti.

goodnight252,
goodnight263,
goodnight263,why?
goodnight263,I don‚Äôt get breaks
goodnight263,Indian Lady (boss) messes with my brain telling me this when in reality it was that
goodnight263,I do most of the stuff
goodnight263,Morning Jobs are not for me, can‚Äôt help but to feel so fucking lazy ugh...
goodnight263,I only get a day off
goodnight263,My foot just hurt so bad

goodnight265,Its so hard to not feeling jealous when the guy I have feelings for couldn‚Äôt spend time with me last week because he was with the same woman and babysitting the kid.
goodnight265,I don‚Äôt want to feel disappointed anymore but I am....
goodnight265,
goodnight270,
goodnight270,Whenever my friend mentions his lover, I wish I could had a lover to stop feeling jealous all the time..
goodnight270,I often get sad when I see pics of naked couples around tumblr or love scenes  because I imagine my friend and her together 
goodnight270, 
goodnight270,It‚Äôs hard to move on by I will because it makes me sick to cry for some stupid crush shit
goodnight270,

goodnight269,After a long late night yesterday, I woke up and it was so boring like plain boring today.
goodnight269,OMG, I just want to this day get over and fucking sleep!!!
goodnight269,I forgot to mention that I love my late Christmas gift from my friend, Michael.
goodnight269,I got 2 PostSecret books on Friday (yesterday) but the funny thing is that he gave me the first edition that I already own (never told him about it).
goodnight269,I wondered, out of the 6-7 books why he chose that one lol?!?!?!
goodnight269,I was about to tell him that but you know what?
goodnight269,I won‚Äôt because I plan to sell the book that I bought and keep the one he gave me :).
goodnight269,Finally,  we spent the rest of the night watching hockey, a movie, and telling each other goodnights.
goodnight269,He‚Äôs such a nice man, friend that I‚Äôm very lucky to have him and I don‚Äôt want to be away from him anymore.
goodnight269,If I were capable of having a bf, it would be him without a doubt..
goodnight269, 
goodnight269,
goodnight273,
goodnight273,I wonder why people are surprised that I‚Äôm 22 and never had worked in my life?!
goodnight273,Is not like I‚Äôm 32 and never had worked lol.
goodnight273,I hope one of two out 3 that I applied will call me soon because I just need money.

goodnight257,I‚Äôm very sad right now because I‚Äôm afraid that I may have some sort of mental disorder because of the following things I‚Äôm experiencing:

goodnight257,My mood swings change frequently 
goodnight257,I‚Äôm depressive

goodnight257, 
goodnight257, 
goodnight257, 
goodnight257,
goodnight250,
goodnight250,When I meet people, I always think you prefer someone else or meet someone else than me...that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt socialize much, to avoid personal preference
goodnight250,
goodnight258,
goodnight258,Everytime he gives me suggestion on how to pursuit men I meet, it makes me sad to know that he doesn‚Äôt get jealous anymore.
goodnight258,I wish he could tell me things that indicate he still interested in me but since he met other girl 11 months back, I‚Äôm defeated.......there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it anymore....
goodnight258,I still wonder what does she has that I don‚Äôt have 
goodnight258,I often scare to tell him, what do you like about her or what made her interesting that you decided to met her and still being with her even if she sucks so often 
goodnight258, 
goodnight258,
goodnight253,
goodnight253,When people ask me about my life, I often make up stories so that people find me interesting instead of my simple plain life..
goodnight253,Its something that I want to stop but seem I can‚Äôt 
goodnight253,
goodnight268,
goodnight268,I finally got a new job as housekeeper in a hotel and I start tomorrow

goodnight268,
goodnight262,
goodnight262,Being illegal sucks because you don‚Äôt have the fair treatments and people (most) are racist towards us (Mexican illegals).
goodnight262,I want to be able to travel the world but with legal documents as many do.
goodnight262,Besides, for the past 14 years nothing has gone well in my life and I just want to start over in my native country from zero, a new beginning.
goodnight262,If I finally decide to move, it will take me time to get use to my country but don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm making my research.
goodnight262,Its something that I really have to think about it before leaving the US permanently.
goodnight262,Here are some of my reasons why I want to leave US:
goodnight262,
goodnight262,I want to be able to have a proper ID without showing my consular card, because I feel embarrass that people take a look and say (don‚Äôt really say :P) ‚Äúoh she‚Äôs illegal‚Äù or  ‚Äúhmmm‚Äù ( long stare if they‚Äôre able to make it eligible).
goodnight262,Work legally and without filling an application with fake ssn when I seek jobs.
goodnight262,Able to have like health insurance (ex.
goodnight262,medicaid, chip or any plan)
goodnight262,Be able to find a job that I‚Äôm comfortable with without the harassment
goodnight262,Able to drive with proper documentation
goodnight262,Able to have for once, citizen rights like many
goodnight262,To Travel to Europe, a long wish that I want so bad
goodnight262,I also want to be able to see the rest of my family before grandma passes away in the future
goodnight262,Be able to have a  proper life for myself and to be free of my sadness and disappointments.
goodnight262,For once, I want to be happy.
goodnight262,I‚Äôll see what happens in a couple of months....

goodnight261,
goodnight261,I started at my new job today and honestly, is very exhausting because I had to clean at least 20-30 rooms!
goodnight261,The lady who is training me seem a bit ‚Äúmean‚Äù , I guess she didn‚Äôt like me much.
goodnight261,Other than that, its not a bad start at housekeeping job.
goodnight261,I only need to learn how to clean the rooms properly and I‚Äôm good to go :). 
goodnight261,
goodnight267,
goodnight267,Second day is already more exhausting than day 1 because the lady who is training me expects me to learn already the entire drill!.
goodnight267,I couldn‚Äôt hold it and told her that I won‚Äôt learn everything in 2 days, shit..drove me mad already and all morning to noon, had done nothing but to told me how I fucked the beds, and how I need to fucking hurry up!.
goodnight267,Me, kept telling her back and to be honest I won‚Äôt put up with her attitude.
goodnight267,Just because I‚Äôm illegal, I won‚Äôt let anyone to treat me ‚Äúbad‚Äù at work or to make me feel less!
goodnight267,For day 2, I already memorize how to clean the bathrooms, clean the furniture, and vacuum the room.
goodnight267,The only issues I have is how to do the bed and the color coding list of rooms that I have to do bed or not, and which bed sheets to grab.
goodnight267,oh, also how to be much faster and get less tired.
goodnight267,I highly don‚Äôt  recommend hotels to anyone, especially if its less than 3.5 rating
goodnight267, 
goodnight267,Reasons why: (about my hotel)
goodnight267,Poor hygiene
goodnight267,The people who are staying for more than 2 days, they get dirty bed sheets.
goodnight267,Pillows are so dirty from inside the pillow covers.
goodnight267,No gloves when cleaning
goodnight267,Lack of staff
goodnight267,Poor hotel sanitary overall
goodnight267,Old furnitures
goodnight267,*2 days and this job is so exhausting that I want to quit

goodnight266,On Friday, my mom‚Äôs lover died and I feel bad because I often talked bad about him with my sister judging him by the way he looked and his job.
goodnight266,It was a very shocking news to me because it was one of the things I never expected and mom was beyond devastated, she‚Äôs doing alright but it will take her time to heal though.
goodnight266,I‚Äôm there to help whenever I can and what she needs.
goodnight266,On Monday, I got a called from another job that I had applied and told me to go on Tuesday (Wings fast food restaurant) and I didn‚Äôt like it.
goodnight266,I felt very pressure when both men who were teaching left me alone there, trying to do about 8-10 orders by myself that I didn‚Äôt know how to do them :(.
goodnight266,Overwhelm by the ladies upfront asking me to ‚Äúhurry‚Äù and I just took off my apron and told another worker to let me go out.
goodnight266,I lasted working there for 4.5 hours.
goodnight266,Then, a lady worker and the boss came to ask me what had happened.
goodnight266,I told them that It became too much and my feet hurt very bad :(.
goodnight266,They talked me through how I shouldn‚Äôt feel down and told me I could comeback tomorrow (today).
goodnight266,I decided not to, I feel embarrass to go back again.
goodnight266,The same day (Monday), I got paid for the first time!!!
goodnight266,It feels so good to have money in my wallet üòÄ
goodnight266,Last Week, there‚Äôs a man who caught my eyes last week at work (hotel) and he‚Äôs very hot, gorgeous.
goodnight266,Well, actually never seen him but I just remembering that I have been cleaning his room but just saw him some days ago (face and everything).
goodnight266,My problem is that I don‚Äôt know how to make him notice or how to ‚Äútalk‚Äù to him lol.
goodnight266,I think he wouldn‚Äôt be attracted to a housekeeper like me and to be honest, I‚Äôm not that pretty either :P. I fantasize about him sexually.
goodnight266,It would be nice to enter his room and fuck him like seriously though.
goodnight266,I want a man/men but I don‚Äôt know how to, I only want it to take the stress away of life...
goodnight266,
goodnight271,

goodnight251,My mom went to a funeral of his lover and was telling me how his body was cold and frozen :(.
goodnight251,She said that it made her sad seeing him like this for the last time.
goodnight251,I often think about death since my friend (who I have feelings for) had a crash.
goodnight251,In the back of my mind, I want to end this ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù because I wouldn‚Äôt like to receive the news that he passed away.
goodnight251,He‚Äôs over there (Canada) and me over here (USA).
goodnight251,Since I‚Äôm illegal, it will be impossible for me to visit him there :'(.
goodnight251,The idea of his death, tears me apart when I think about it.

goodnight260,It has been 4 days since I started working and I‚Äôm completely dead all day.
goodnight260,I have understood 70% of the duties that I have to do daily and I want to quit so bad already.
goodnight260,Cleaning rooms is the most unpleasant thing!!!
goodnight260,The bad thing is that guests like me because I‚Äôm the only one who can speak fully English and I literally a miracle.
goodnight260,A guy gave me $5 to clean all his room when today I was only supposed to take the trash and add additional towels, good thing tho :).
goodnight260,My mom tells me that even if I quit this job, every single job is exhausting anyways.
goodnight260,Tomorrow, it will be one of the  busiest day and I don‚Äôt wanna go :(.
goodnight260,I feel like I haven‚Äôt talk to my friend, Michael in a longtime (only 2 days) and I hope we can watch a movie tonight because I miss him all the time.
goodnight260,I hate that I like him alot :(, what can I do!?!?
goodnight260,he is just too nice to me and so kind, I‚Äôm overwhelm *-*

goodnight256,
goodnight255,
goodnight255,It‚Äôs been almost a week and a half and I still don‚Äôt get a job.
goodnight255,No calls, no interviews, nothing..it makes me sad because the another year will pass and I still will be a fucking loser.
goodnight255,I‚Äôm out options for now.
goodnight255,Studying for the GED is really hard because I often lazy and get sleep halfway through and end up studying for only 30 mins.
goodnight255,Right now, I could had study but I‚Äôm not or hours ago but I didn‚Äôt.
goodnight255,I still lack so much motivation as well as to lose weight!!
goodnight255,I‚Äôm often scare of the future because I‚Äôm wasting it huge and I don‚Äôt know what to do.
goodnight255,I just don‚Äôt want to have anymore mistakes nor regrets.
goodnight255,I‚Äôm lost...At 22, I should know what to do in my fucking life, to have my shit on..( in my opinion ).
goodnight255,I‚Äôm not complaining, I‚Äôm reviewing my own thoughts.

goodnight255,I hate how life is complicated lol 
goodnight255,

goodnight272,I finished watching Turbo Kid with my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù, MichaeÃàl.
goodnight272,I was surprised how I love this funny quirky movie!
goodnight272,He recommended for us to watch it but I was highly skeptical of his choice because sci-fi comedy is not really my thing.
goodnight272,I was wrong :).
goodnight272,Just some minutes ago, we talked about it and told each others goodnight.
goodnight272,For tonight, I‚Äôm a happy girl even if I felt some sort of shitty hours ago.
goodnight272,He knows how to make me feel definitely better and the fact that he was smiling because I wanted to watch a movie with him is priceless.
goodnight272,Our days together will be over in 2 weeks because he will return to work at nights everyday after a car crash that left him temporarily injured.
goodnight272,I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs alive and he‚Äôs feeling better each day üòÄ <3
