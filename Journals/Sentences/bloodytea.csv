goodnight68,I want to give up my house and all my things and become a couch surfer.
goodnight68,I want to shoot up a bunch of meth so I never pass out so I never have to dream.
goodnight68,I want fuck men who don’t want to love or to hold me because I cant have the one who I want to love and hold me.
goodnight68,I want to wonder the streets at 3am only caring about one thing and that’s to score some dope.
goodnight68,I want to not be concerned about anything but how drunk I can get.
goodnight68,I want to ruin my brain with drugs so I don’t have to think anymore.
goodnight68,I want to leave panties in strange mens beds and call business men daddy when they buy me drinks.
goodnight68,I want to throw out my name and my number and become no one.
goodnight68,I want to steal all my clothes from the goodwill and not shower for days on end.
goodnight68,grow a bush under each arm and walk around looking like I have a fruby in a head lock.
goodnight68,ill stop wearing deodorant and  loose a few teeth due to the meth.
goodnight68,I want to kill my self right now so bad the thoughts scare me.
goodnight68,
goodnight76,
goodnight76,     I took a bit of the sun.
goodnight76,Surprisingly Is wasn’t as hot as one would think.
goodnight76,delectable
goodnight76,scrumptious
goodnight76,I am chlorophyll
goodnight76,Organs thrive
goodnight76,MY organs thrive
goodnight76,Release and consume.
goodnight76,I am honey I am pollen
goodnight76,Pulling and drawing
goodnight76,breathing,
goodnight76, scream at the cut
goodnight76,healing  from the blade,
goodnight76,I have eaten the Sun,
goodnight76,I gave it back
goodnight76,Again.
goodnight76, 
goodnight76,
goodnight67,
goodnight67,     I can feel it now.
goodnight67,I am nothing but a shell of who I once was.
goodnight67,I cant keep him any longer.
goodnight67,not like this.
goodnight67,He is hurting, more then hurting me.
goodnight67,He is ripping me apart.
goodnight67,I cant live like this any longer.
goodnight67,Every think he says to me rips me apart.
goodnight67,I am walking on egg shells.
goodnight67,I love him for who he once was but this has gotten to the point I am afraid of him.
goodnight67,There is no being told that I am beautiful.
goodnight67,There is no being told thanks I did a good job or that I am loved or respected.
goodnight67,There are no more sweet nothings or holding hands.
goodnight67,All there is is abuse.
goodnight67,I am slipping away now.
goodnight67,last night I took the wrong turn on the way home.
goodnight67,I should have taken the quicker.
goodnight67,He just screamed and screamed “How could you be so retarded,  your worthless, dumb cunt, I hate how you drive, you ruined every ones night....” It just kept going on and on until I started throwing up all over my self and my fresh washed car.
goodnight67,After I pulled over covered in my own puke he got out of the car yelled some more things at me and the walked home leaving me alone covered in my own puke on the side of the road.
goodnight67,Today I didn’t make the eggs dry enough for break fast, then I didn’t pick out the right clothes to wear, I had my heat up to high and he was hot, I hid in the bedroom to get away from the yelling then I was being lazy laying around and doing nothing.
goodnight67,I didn’t say the right thing at the store, my house wasn’t clean enough, I tried to be sexy and put on something hot I had bought to surprise him but he said he didn’t like it, I tried to tell him I was hurt and how I felt but he just said he didn’t want to hear me bitch and I was being annoying nagging him.
goodnight67,Eventually after more screaming at me he stormed out of the house and now here I am.
goodnight67,I am not even crying this time.
goodnight67,I feel numb.
goodnight67,I cant take it anymore.
goodnight67,I know I am better then this and I would be better alone then abused.
goodnight67,I need to get back to being my self.
goodnight67,So I am choosing now to lift my self up and considering my self as of now under construction.
goodnight67,I just cant go on like this anymore.
goodnight67,
goodnight72,
goodnight72,I hate you.
goodnight72,I hate you for all the times you abused me and made me out to be the crazy one when I started to cry.
goodnight72,I hate the broken bones and bruises.
goodnight72,I hate your lies.
goodnight72,Your so selfish it makes me sick.
goodnight72,I hate how you never listen to me.
goodnight72,I hate when I poor my heart out to you and you say “what’s your point?”
goodnight72,   I should let you go.
goodnight72,I should have left you long ago.
goodnight72,I never turned you in when I should have.
goodnight72,Instead I lie and say I fell down the stairs.
goodnight72,I defend you  “it was really all my fault” “I had it coming” I love you so.
goodnight72,I love your smell, our thoughts every thing about you.
goodnight72,your killing me.
goodnight72,Why cant you just be good to me?
goodnight72,You say intentions don’t matter so I allow my self to think maybe I’m not doing a good enough job.
goodnight72,I give you all I have to give so much I don’t even know how I do it.
goodnight72,you say trying doesn’t count so I allow my self to think he is right I need to do a better job.
goodnight72,I love you and treat you like a king as I am always walking on egg shells.
goodnight72,You punish me and blame me for your own mistakes.
goodnight72,I tell people how much I care about you and how great you are as I am wearing sun glasses to cover my black eyes.
goodnight72,My life is falling apart and I want all this pain to end and I know  it will not unless I leave you for good.
goodnight72,One of the worst ways you abuse me is pretending to leave me and then act like I’m the one crawling back to you when you know you really never left me in the first place.
goodnight72,I threat to never see me again if I don’t do what you want but in the end you always see me the next day or two and I say I’m sorry for the mess you created and blamed on me.
goodnight72,I need to stop all this I need to let myself get this farce idea of you out of my head.
goodnight72,I look at you like a God when the truth is you are just an abuser.
goodnight72, 
goodnight72,
goodnight48,
goodnight48,     What is wrong with me that I keep putting my self through this?
goodnight48,I keep telling my self I am leaving and not going back.
goodnight48,I always go back.
goodnight48,Yet again I have another bruise.
goodnight48,This time was even more scary.
goodnight48,I couldn’t even stand to look at him whit his hands around my neck.
goodnight48,What if he didn’t let go when he did?
goodnight48,Does he have it in me to kill me?
goodnight48,At one time I would have thought of course not, Now I am not so sure anymore.
goodnight48,I just feel so stupid I cry and I cry and scream begging him to stop.
goodnight48,I just want it all to stop.
goodnight48,I feel so stupid.
goodnight48,What the hell is wrong with me?
goodnight48,I am a smart woman.
goodnight48,I know the abuse will not stop.
goodnight48,It will only get worse.
goodnight48,How much worse can it get before I am back in the ER with a broken bone lying to a doctor about falling down the steps or even worse dead.
goodnight48,
goodnight56,
goodnight56,      I had had plans tonight, nothing too special just a 5$ concert that I can honestly go either way on but the point is I had plans.
goodnight56,It was at 7pm.
goodnight56,So at 4pm I had on my dress and my makeup on all perfect and was ready to go at 6:15.
goodnight56,I always get ready and leave early because of my abnormal fear of being late.
goodnight56,Then close to 5pm I was notified that plans have changed.
goodnight56,Not only did plans change with us not going but plans also changed with my boyfriend being able to come over tonight turns out he has to make a deadline for work and is going to stay at his place tonight instead of mine because he has to use his computer to do the project.
goodnight56,UGH!!!
goodnight56,What a nightmare!!!!!
goodnight56,Its not that I am mad at him or feel like I need to see him that bad or that I really wanted to go to the concert its just that the plans changed.
goodnight56,When plans change or things don’t go as expected I can have a very hard time dealing with it.
goodnight56,Being an ASPI switching focus can be challenging.
goodnight56,Yes I am a grown woman and I will and do get over it but its still hard.
goodnight56,I try not to act out or have a melt down which usually consist of crying or trying to figure out how to make something still work that wont work things like that lol nothing dangerous but still crappy.
goodnight56,Still though I feel panic.
goodnight56,Being an adult with adult responsibilities I have to manage the panic very carefully.
goodnight56,I will do deep breathing and try to find something else to focus on but truth is I still feel the great upset and the only thing that I can do is just suck it up deal with being upset and get over it which could take minutes or hours or maybe till the next day.
goodnight56,I am feeling it now but I am okay it just really sucks.
goodnight56,So I told him “good night” which is my code for I’m not mad at you but I may get upset with you even though its not your fault so I am giving my self time to get over it and feel better.
goodnight56,then he said, “ill see you in the morning” I then asked what time and I got 8am out of him.
goodnight56,I cant stand when I don’t know an exact time frame it drives me bonkers!
goodnight56,I hate not knowing things!!!!!!
goodnight56,I deal with it when I have to but I try to always know what plans are what times and things like that.
goodnight56,If I say go to a party then in my head I will also plan what time I think I will leave when it gets close to that time I start to get antsy.
goodnight56,Say if I am at the party with him and its close to time to go but he is not getting ready to go yet and I ask him how much longer and he says “i don’t know” this makes me feel very uneasy.
goodnight56,“to me I don’t know” means could be in one minute or it could be forever.
goodnight56,I need at to know at lest a ball park range to feel okay.
goodnight56,for example it is easier for me to deal with between 8pm and 10pm.
goodnight56, 
goodnight56,
goodnight55,
goodnight55,    Ted woke up at 6:42am wondering where the cat was that shit in his mouth.
goodnight55,Ted always set his alarm for slightly strange times like 6:47, 6:51....
goodnight55,This way Ted figured he would be to tired to work out the proper math in his head to know if he could push snooze or not and would be forced to just get up.
goodnight55,Ted brushes his teeth for what feels like forever but is actually only about 30 seconds.
goodnight55,In Teds closet there are 7 pairs of brown pants and 7 white collared button up dress shirts and 7 tan ties.
goodnight55,Ted doesn’t care about style and figures this routine makes his life simple and easy to manage.
goodnight55,Ted only buys new clothes when his old ones are no longer adequate and he buys the same close from the same online store every time.
goodnight55,Ted also figures that He saves about 30 hours a year not having to shop in stores looking for the perfect outfits and sorting laundry.
goodnight55,After putting on his brown pants white shirt and tan tie Ted drops his red plaid pajamas (which he also has exactly 7 pairs of)  into the hamper.
goodnight55,Ted now takes a long look in the bathroom mirror and wonders if he hadn’t worn hats during his youth if he would still have hair.
goodnight55,However this thought is pointless because Ted does not have hair.
goodnight55,Ted eats a simple bowl of cheerios for breakfast.
goodnight55,His chewing sounds likes grinding rocks and slightly bothers him but Ted gets over it and eats his cheerios all the same.
goodnight55,Ted never drinks the milk he dumps it down the sink  washes the bowl and the spoon dries with a towel and puts away directly after he is done.
goodnight55,This way upon his arrival home from work at 5:30pm his apartment will feel clean, warm and inviting.
goodnight55,Ted has two pairs of shoes both black slip on dress shoes.
goodnight55,Ted slips on the his work pair grabs his briefcase and walks out the door at precisely  7:35.
goodnight55,This gives Ted 20 minutes to get to work because 5 minutes early is on time.
goodnight55,Ted only lives 10 minutes from his office but figures an extra five minutes for traffic.
goodnight55,If there happens to be little to no traffic Ted will get to work early and simply wait in his car.
goodnight55,Ted gets out of his car at 7:53 which gives him one minute to enter the building and one extra minute incase a passing coworker or stranger stops to say hello and there for he is obligated to say hello back.
goodnight55,This insures Ted will arrive at work at exactly 7:55am which is just on time.
goodnight55,This is Teds morning.
goodnight55,Teds morning has not changed for the last 20 years and 257 days.
goodnight55,
goodnight64,
goodnight64,“Babar?”, “Babar are you here?”
goodnight64,“Yes my dear I am here... well sorta.”
goodnight64,“sorta?” “Babar you have me confused.”

goodnight64,“Babar what ever do you mean?”

goodnight78,
goodnight78,   I realize that most people tell about them selves in there first entry how ever my hands have a mind of there own and seemed to have other plans.
goodnight78,So here we go about ME ME ME!!!!!!
goodnight78,Most people would say I am eccentric.
goodnight78,I would have to agree with this statement being that I do live in a small 8×9 foot bubble under the sea with of course my 24 foot pet dragon which can at times be dreadfully annoying with his awful snoring habits and all but hey I can complain much he is the one who has to put up with my horrid morning breath!
goodnight78,Oh and then of course I have two wild heathens who follow me around everywhere I go named Sambo and Woeden .
goodnight78,Such helpless little savages.
goodnight78,They get up dreadfully early and don’t stop nagging with there high pitched shrieks until I at last allow them to lick the earwax from the previous days Qtips.
goodnight78,so Eccentric..?
goodnight78,Yes I find this quit fitting.
goodnight78,My favorite is yellow.
goodnight78,In fact I like yellow so much I have even taken it upon my self to harvest 26 rittleboppers from the earth and name them all Yellow.
goodnight78,In case you don’t know what a rittlebopper is here is the definition,
goodnight78,Rittleopper- A small animal like plant that sorta looks like a tiny thingordoodle on the third day of the 9 settings sun and lives for exactly 891 years and 3 days while crying tears of joy the whole time in a pitch too low for the human ear to hear and only eats green lima beans every 3erd sunday.
goodnight78,I also Like to play the piano.
goodnight78,I once composed a song so great I got the honor of playing for the queen of wombonboo and her 72 cousins.
goodnight78,Afterwards we all had tea.
goodnight78,So there is a little about me if you would like to know anything else please just ask
goodnight78, 
goodnight78,
goodnight58,
goodnight58,       Almighty empress am I.
goodnight58,Down bellow the billowing winds and rays of light projected through grains of glass created from my sands.
goodnight58,Little specks of truth handed down like an old kings soul.
goodnight58,She did not notice.
goodnight58,Truth be told neither did I.
goodnight58,He didn’t breathe, there was no need.
goodnight58,Stories outline the maps we look at every day which only becomes visible after dark.
goodnight58,Midnight magic causes cramp.
goodnight58,Dreary dwells the sound.
goodnight58,Hushing for the sake of the baby.
goodnight58,The sounds of the whom.
goodnight58,A sarcophagus nailed shut keeps the pressure.
goodnight58,Let it be my dear let it be.
goodnight58,Sakes are short, lines wiggle; with this candle life is simple.
goodnight58,Adventure is simple, a grand expedition easy does it.
goodnight58,No need to see the end.
goodnight58,It doesn’t matter.
goodnight58,Grave warnings, giggling groups of fish.
goodnight58,“Where did my head go?” “did you check under the bed?” I did I did it wasn’t there” “how about behind the door?” “oh no my silly Babar I only leave it there Friday and Tuesday nights.” “oh well I suppose my head has a mind of its own, it will show up when its ready.” “oh goodness I do declare how preposterous of me!
goodnight58,it is not my head I have lost for it was here the whole time.
goodnight58,No no I am afraid it is my body that seems to have gone missing” “you mean it just grew legs and walked away?” “perhaps or maybe just slithered in its usual way” “no need to fret a quick trip to the store and I shall have another.”
goodnight58,
goodnight74,
goodnight74,    Beckon for me I want to hear the scream faint as a wispier.
goodnight74,Call upon me to beg for your fire.
goodnight74,Wash me of my sins and watch me dance in the presents of your sent.
goodnight74,This glory will not come again.
goodnight74,I would be a fool not bow nor sing thy name.
goodnight74,I could smell it on you from the day we met.
goodnight74,Your edge so sharp like a diamond.
goodnight74,I didn’t need to ask who and what you were.
goodnight74,life is a returnable gift.
goodnight74,As far as I know a gift I did not ask for.
goodnight74,Life it is like unwrapping from the goodwill it could be super cool and exactly what you wanted of it could be shit.
goodnight74,Sometimes its good but you don’t notice because of all the other gifts (lives) you get caught up in and yours gets pushed to the side and sometimes you so see how great it is and are so glad its all yours that you want to do one of two things keep it all to your self or share it with someone maybe even the world, then there are the bad gifts.
goodnight74,some bad gifts you can rearrange into something great or if you cant rearrange totally into something great you may find someone or a few maybe a lot who will share pieces of there gift with you till you have enough to add it to your reinventing it with your new pieces to make great.
goodnight74,then there are the gifts that are so shitty that you can not rearrange them into anything better at all and its so bad that others wont come close enough to your gift to share there.
goodnight74,the other shitty gifts my hang around your shitty gift but that usually just makes a bigger pile of shit.
goodnight74,so what kind of gift have I got... honestly I am not really sure nor am I sure when it will be returned but like all gifts good and bad they all sooner or latter got returned rather you return by choice lose it or just parish leaving it behind to be forgotten it may take a long time but nothing last forever.
goodnight74,Some day we will not recall the name Ann Frank or even Jesus Christ.
goodnight74,You can argue the point all you want but it is only your fear of loss that will be speaking and you own silly little prides which also in the end mean nothing.
goodnight74, 
goodnight74,

goodnight65,     How strange, someone has wrote in my journal.
goodnight65,You would think I would be mad but I’m not.
goodnight65,In a way its interesting and creepy all at the same time.
goodnight65,I thought about changing my password but you know what?
goodnight65,I am not going to.
goodnight65,I sorta liked the excitement.
goodnight65,Feel fee to write in my journal again who ever you are.
goodnight65,
goodnight63,
goodnight63,    I lost Tia.
goodnight63,She was here about 8 months ago, haven’t seen here sense.
goodnight63,
goodnight71,
goodnight71,     Dear Jebus why do I love this ?
goodnight71,He is hurting me so bad.
goodnight71,I get away for small amounts of time by writing and playing my piano and bass but the issue is always still there.
goodnight71,He is hurting me.
goodnight71,Sure we have our good times which is I guess why I stay but deep down I know this cant be worth it.
goodnight71,He is crazy too crazy even for me.
goodnight71,Why is the though of me being with out him so hard to take?
goodnight71,Every time I say will be the last time but I always go back.
goodnight71,I hate having to come up with a new lie every time it happens.
goodnight71,“I slipped in the shower and broke my arm.”, “I ran into a door and broke my nose.”, “I tripped down my stairs and got a concussion and two black eyes.” these are just some of the things I said knowing fully they are all lies.
goodnight71,Its not just the bruises and broken bones though its even more then that.
goodnight71,Its being called retarded and a cunt it being yelled at in the car for taking a different way then he wanted to take.
goodnight71,Its being invited over to his place only to have him treat me like crap till I start to cry and then him tell me to get out and go home that he doesn’t want me there.
goodnight71,Its so hard to believe how he can do these things to me and yet other days be the best man I have ever had slow dancing with me and taking off my jacket when we go to dinner.
goodnight71,We have pretty much every thing in common even the really odd things I thought I  would never find in anyone but me.
goodnight71,anti religious anti military hates cops and loves are and music in odd forms most unheard of.
goodnight71,He even asked me to merry him I said yes.
goodnight71,Now that all seems not to matter so much because the bad is out weighing the good ten fold.
goodnight71,I feel so ugly and so worthless around him all the time now.
goodnight71,I have to stop this some how I have to get away.
goodnight71,I am a smart woman I know it is better to be alone then be abused but why do I feel so inlove to him I just cant go.
goodnight71,I always do anything for him he asks me to do no questions.
goodnight71,I follow him anywhere and am always cleaning up his shit.
goodnight71,I thought if I could be good enough to him he would see that and start being good t me like he used to be but I realize now it is him not me.
goodnight71,There is nothing I could do or say to change things now it will only get worse.
goodnight71,He will not listen or care about what I have to say.
goodnight71,He will not wake up and think oh shit she is gone I need to change... been there done that.
goodnight71,He will treat me the way he wants and  I cant change that.
goodnight71,This feeling is so shitty and I want it to go away.
goodnight71,I need t be my strong self I was before I met him not this empty shell of a person I have become.
goodnight71,I know that I should be with someone who makes me feel beautiful and wanted who does not his me or call me names or kicks me out when he is drunk.
goodnight71,So why is it so hard then!?
goodnight71,It has gotten to the point where no one even believes the lies and I have lost all my friends and even my own mother called bs on me the last time I told “I fell down” it broke my heart hearing her say “I already buried one baby and cant bare to burry another”.
goodnight71,So now I just lie and say to her that we broke up and don’t visit her if I have an injury I cant cover with clothes or make up.
goodnight71,I feel like my heart has been ripped out and burned at the stake.
goodnight71,I am such a smart girl I really am so why am I doing this to my self?
goodnight71,Its so stupid how I agree with him every time he hurts me that its my fault.
goodnight71,I know damn well him catching me smoking a cigarette is no reason to get hit or me telling him my period is late is no reason to get hit by his car but I do agree I say its my fault and tell him I am sorry I caused him to hurt me so we can just get over it and he can be happy and pleased and we can move on.
goodnight71,The first time it happened he gave me two black eves and a bloody lip he felt so bad the next day he even cried and I though he would never do it again but I was wrong and what is even worse he as never told me he was sorry or showed me any remorse again.
goodnight71,I feel like I am nothing but trash to him so I try even harder to treat him like a king.
goodnight71,I am to good for him anyone could see that.
goodnight71,I just have to mentally find a way out of this.
goodnight71,
goodnight57,

goodnight57,I am extremely loyal and honest.
goodnight57,lying and being not being faithful is something my mind just does not process very well.
goodnight57,I feel so proud of my self at times.
goodnight57,Me the little blond mute girl that all through growing up people treated so fragile, Me that girl that her family planned on me never moving away from home having a family of my own and an education.

goodnight57,I am a grown 25 year old educated woman with two beautiful intelligent children my own business, living on my own with my own little family.
goodnight57,I have a car and pay my own bills.
goodnight57,But not only did I prove everyone wrong I have went beyond that.
goodnight57,I am more put together than most mothers my age at all.
goodnight57,I do need help with somethings still and I do get it when it is needed but the way I see it is everything needs help with something and hey I drive my own car and provide for my own family and beyond.

goodnight66,    The truth is I am okay.
goodnight66,I may not feel like it most of the time as of lately but I am okay.
goodnight66,I have been through hell and back and Here I am I am still here.
goodnight66,I may be damaged but I will heal.

goodnight66,I have a car to drive.
goodnight66,I have my art and my music.
goodnight66,Most of all I have my two beautiful perfect children and I have my mother who loves me deeply.

goodnight66,I have to look at the facts rationally.
goodnight66,I am a great mother.
goodnight66,I am a good honest person.

goodnight66,
goodnight50,
goodnight50,     I often hear people saying they have no filter and will say whatever they want because there not fake.
goodnight50,Its not being “fake” its called being a mature adult with morals and values... Not sure how you people were raised but where I come from if you don’t have anything nice to say then don’t say anything at all.
goodnight50,Sure if you need to stand up for your self to a bully or something that you believe in that’s one thing.
goodnight50,However if you are just going around being rude and hurting feelings then try and keep that to your self.
goodnight50,Sometimes I make a mistake and say something rude and not even notice and if it is pointed out to me I will apologize no problem.
goodnight50,Accidents happen but there is no good reason to be hurtful and mean on purpose.
goodnight50,And further more even if you were not raised to use curtesy and respect as a grown adult you should be able to use basic human sense and figure it out.
goodnight50,Its not rocket science to be nice to others.
goodnight50,Also the people I always hear saying this never say things with tact.
goodnight50,For example there is a difference between saying privately to some one “Hey I just thought you should know your makeup is not blended very well and it is obvious.” and then there is this out loud in front of others, ” your face doesn’t match your neck!”  see what I mean you can say the same thing nicely or you could be very hurtful.
goodnight50,So just because you “don’t have a filter because you are not fake” does not give you a free pass to be an ass!
goodnight50,and that’s my rant for the day, lol off my soap box now.
goodnight50,By the way this entry is not about anyone in particular its just something I hear a lot that really annoys me.
goodnight50,
goodnight75,
goodnight75,    I hate when I question what our troops are fighting for and they say our “freedom”.
goodnight75,People seem to get safety and freedom mixed up.
goodnight75,Yes in America we a safer from many things other countries are not, except pollution, obesity, unhealthy food and poverty of course.
goodnight75,However America is not free.
goodnight75,I am not an asshole I am just simply looking at the cold hard facts.
goodnight75,America I number one in three things, obesity, incarceration and laws.
goodnight75,Yes you heard me correctly America “the land of the free’ has more laws then any other country.
goodnight75,on the list of freest countries in the world America does not even make in the list of top ten in fact we are way down at number 20!!!
goodnight75,I am not saying you can not be grateful to live here or have to be “anti-American” but at least look at and admit the truth.
goodnight75,America is not a free country or the land of the free.
goodnight75,America is one of the most heavily patrolled countries in the would proving quit the opposite of freedom.
goodnight75,Stop blindly believing what ever you are told do some fair honest studying on both sides of the fence and also look around you using common sense and your own mind.
goodnight75,Sure we may feel safe here and no one is getting burned at the steak for being gay “thank God!” but we are not as free as you think you know as you are taught.
goodnight75,Sometimes in order to gain freedom one must give up safety.
goodnight75,I would make the payment of possible safety for true freedom and others would not.
goodnight75,either choice is okay equally okay.
goodnight75,All I am asking is lets just be honest about it.
goodnight75,
goodnight49,
goodnight49,Seraphric affection,
goodnight49,Rogue Sovereign,
goodnight49,For who I have marked time loyally before your coming.
goodnight49,Upon arrival of you particular lure.
goodnight49,Madcapped benevolence swept though this vessel.
goodnight49,Electric regards  for my knight fell apace.
goodnight49,Oh how all Gods in heaven shall never dissever our hearts that bind beyond time and space.
goodnight49, 
goodnight49,

goodnight59,
goodnight59,      I have two young kids, I love them deeply and like most other mothers want the to grow up intelligent, wise and destined for great things.
goodnight59,I also know that creativity and imagination is the cornerstone for this.
goodnight59,Without creativity the world would not and will not progress.
goodnight59,Sadly most adults have lost all imagination.
goodnight59,I am talking about having the ability to wonder, to think outside of your world and what is happing right now.
goodnight59,The ability to not only retain information of what is taught to you by others but to create your own thoughts and ideas.
goodnight59,Schools teach our kids the alphabet and how to counts to 100.
goodnight59,They teach how to identify colors and shapes.
goodnight59,These are all things they will learn in life rather we try to teach them these things or not.
goodnight59,Schools also teach, glue the white cotton balls on the sheep, color inside of the lines, water is blue and fish live inside of the water and birds fly in the sky.
goodnight59,I WILL NOT TEACH MY KIDS TO COLOR INSIDE THE LINES!!!!!
goodnight59,Teaching a child to color inside of the lines takes away there creativity.
goodnight59,Creativity is curtail to the human race and our life as we know it.
goodnight59,To take away ones creativity is to take away there intelligence.
goodnight59,As a whole we are raising our children to become artificial life forms not unique intelligent individuals to progress the forward movement of the earth.
goodnight59,I WILL TEACH MY CHILDREN there art is beautiful inside and outside of the lines.
goodnight59,I will teach my children that it is okay to imagine water can be purple fish can fly and birds life under the sea.
goodnight59,As adults we should try live this way as well.
goodnight59,To think and create for our selves.
goodnight59,What if I wake up tomorrow and a magical fairy with pink butterfly wings spits fire into my soul and I then become a mermaid?
goodnight59,Sound silly?
goodnight59,well its not.
goodnight59,It is important and intelligent to think like this.
goodnight59,Come on people are we forgetting the world is full of infinite possibilities.
goodnight59,Answering questions right or wrong is not the most important thing.
goodnight59,Asking questions is the most important thing.   
goodnight59,
goodnight77,
goodnight77,   As our fight went down to the river still we never prayed.
goodnight77,Now its come down to this fist to face I wont let you win.
goodnight77,He wont let me win.
goodnight77,Baby you have broke my heart and ate me whole.
goodnight77,now where do we go from here when we both don’t go.
goodnight77,down in the river where we never pray.
goodnight77,I love with all my might.
goodnight77,That will never charge.
goodnight77,You try and say I am the one that’s real however now I know this is only a gas light.
goodnight77,I love you so much I will hurt you and hurt my self.
goodnight77,If we both cant win I will not give the submission only runs to the point of dream and now I have seen where the is no light.
goodnight77,that is not a dream but stupid little thing bigger than the both of us.
goodnight77,Now I cant think to speak how long you waited for this day.
goodnight77,I bet you think that thing will go your way.
goodnight77,You are always wrong.
goodnight77,You tried to run away I held you down with my own arms this your force broke me again and the I ran away where you found tied to the tub pulling me away.
goodnight77,It was only a joke when you cried out in pain.
goodnight77,selfish deeds and using me will only bread more shit.
goodnight77,How can you not see how your always wrong.
goodnight77,I wont let you go even when you run Ill be a punching bag before you can leave the scene.
goodnight77,Don’t you lie and say you wont love me.
goodnight77,Don’t you be a fool again to say your leaving me only to return again.
goodnight77,Don’t you think I have learned by now these are only words and you are to go I’m right behind you as you pretend your running for me you only just fast enough for me to trip on your shoe.
goodnight77,no you will never go.
goodnight77,if I drown you drown too.
goodnight77,so what if I am dark so what if I am crazy.
goodnight77,ill eat you whole you will live inside of me.
goodnight77,I got my fork and iv got my knife ready to jump inside my self after you.
goodnight77,you chase me away to grasp my hair and drag me back.
goodnight77,I push you out until you agree to go and then board up your walls you are never leaving me again.
goodnight77,
goodnight69,
goodnight69,  My cement high-rise, Inside I swelter,
goodnight69,tick, tick, a slaves time is to slow for a tock
goodnight69,Looking out this bay of plexi down on to the armored ants honking and beeping
goodnight69,with no time for a tock there is certainly no time to spare for the numbskull in front who ignores changing lights with heavy eyes.
goodnight69,Quick, slick, loafers swift drift alarm the daydreamer back to drudge
goodnight69,Tap, Tap, Tap an endless see of taps and the a space.
goodnight69,tap, tap, space, enter.
goodnight69,Jazz Jiving servitude,
goodnight69,until just one final..
goodnight69,TICK!
goodnight69,A slight smirk of jubilance
goodnight69,Back to MY own armored ant and then MY hut in which where I collect MY keep
goodnight69,ZZZZZZZZZ.......
goodnight69,BUZZZZZ
goodnight69,Armored ant, cement high-rise, porthole, drudge, Jazz Jive, TICK, armored ant, zzzzzzz, buzz
goodnight69,Perplexed

goodnight53,
goodnight53,      Winters death is near.
goodnight53,Its a beautiful and gloomy day.
goodnight53,Its about to rain I can smell it, one of my favorite scents.
goodnight53,So this morning I have opened all the windows of my home.
goodnight53,As I feel the fresh wind  blowing through the house and the seasons changing I can feel my life changing as  well.
goodnight53,In the last month I have lost 22 lbs then for the last few days I have messed up.
goodnight53,I am going to think of the last few days as just a simple break from my life style and get back on it today.
goodnight53,We all need a break sometimes right?
goodnight53,
goodnight61,
goodnight61,    So I run an in-home daycare.
goodnight61,I actually went to school to be a preschool teacher but then found out I make much better money running a daycare from my home especially because then I don’t have to pay for my kids daycare this way while I am working.
goodnight61,I will never get rich of off an in-home daycare but I am okay with that.
goodnight61,We have more than enough and I am happy.
goodnight61,Its funny with my tattoos and abstract writing and other things about me I don’t think a lot of people would expect me to be one to work with kids.
goodnight61,But I do and I love it.
goodnight61,Honestly I don’t think I would love anything else as much as I do teaching and working with children.
goodnight61,Teaching preschoolers has always been my what I wanted to do when I grew up.
goodnight61,I am lucky to be one of the few people that can say I am what I wanted to be when I grew up.
goodnight61,I am good at what I do so its pretty easy to get customers for me.
goodnight61,I put together unique lesson plans.
goodnight61,We do not watch tv at all which is a great selling point for child care.
goodnight61,Every day we do art, music, reading and math or science.
goodnight61,I provide much healthier food then most daycares and I truly love being able to have just enough kids to be able to do group projects and games but also spend one on one time with each one.
goodnight61,To a point I also get to set my own hours and I love that lol who wouldn’t?!
goodnight61,SO ....
goodnight61,Todsay I have TWO new kids coming!!!!!!!
goodnight61,I am so excited!
goodnight61,I am wearing my favorite red long flowered dress to make a good impression and have plans to take them to the park across the street if it is nice enough. 
goodnight61,
goodnight52,
goodnight52,    words mean something and so did I. I didn’t go there and then I did.
goodnight52,I get it , I get what means.
goodnight52,Knowledge.
goodnight52,woe, Joy, I didn’t know, I didn’t know it was so great.
goodnight52,How did I become again.
goodnight52,Why did it start?
goodnight52,I have honestly the answers only ides, I how no ides.
goodnight52,
goodnight79,
goodnight79,     Mondays can be Dark however never as dark as a Sunday.
goodnight79,Bringing the blood thirsty beast out in the night.
goodnight79,Calling her calling her away from me.
goodnight79,Can it be Cant it really truly be?
goodnight79,How strange how easy parts of us can be so easily rapped and stolen away from us?
goodnight79,Where do these pieces go?
goodnight79,Perhaps in a sepulcher next to our masters bed.
goodnight79,Ah yes the master may choose the keep the dead pieces of they so wish to.
goodnight79,Master what a thoughtful name for such a thief however so fitting.
goodnight79,For if you allow one to take a piece of your inside meaningful or not you still have and there for they have mastered you.
goodnight79,After no one has ever said one must like its master.
goodnight79,Hell the Master doesn’t even have to feed.
goodnight79,Owners are not always so sweet as you may wish.
goodnight79,Sometimes they choose to let there own property die.
goodnight79,To watch it burn from the inside out.
goodnight79,Never a thought never even a question why.
goodnight79,To master a sheep you are a dog to master a dog you are a butcher and to master a butcher you are a boss to be worshiped by the strong and to eat the weak.
goodnight79,Desire holds it close and fear keeps it closer, that is if you are smart.
goodnight79,A dog will take his pray by force.
goodnight79,like all animals a dog is filth.
goodnight79,If you are to be mastered by an animal of such filth as a Dog maybe you should burn.
goodnight79,Maybe your ashes well smell better.
goodnight79,I God is cunning and sly.
goodnight79,A God will get what it wants before you even under stand that you are in the mouth of a monster.
goodnight79,If you can look into the mouth of a monster and still with all your heart beg to sit by his side for worship then you are the butcher.
goodnight79,
goodnight51,
goodnight51,     Smiles gleam so radiant.
goodnight51,A sliver tongue, so charming.
goodnight51,An electric touch sends surges through my body.
goodnight51,What a high!
goodnight51,His embrace of enchanting magic.
goodnight51,For the beast my regard quickly became rather tender.
goodnight51,How peculiarly drawn I was to the beast.
goodnight51,Even knowing that in fact he was indeed a beast.
goodnight51,My thoughts were positive.
goodnight51,I do have a beast and this beast loves and cares for me like no other flesh and blood man ever has.
goodnight51,Enlightened,  I was elated to have the privilege to belong to such a creature.
goodnight51,Who would have ever thought it would be me.
goodnight51,For once in my life I was the lucky one.
goodnight51,I was warned, I was  told by many to run and yet I stayed loyal by his side.
goodnight51,It was no matter to me if others were so blind as to not see my luck.
goodnight51,He was my God and beside him was I his queen and together just like that we would stay.
goodnight51,A beast is a beast I suppose.
goodnight51,I am a wise young gentlewoman.
goodnight51,I understood a beasts comes with beastly issues.
goodnight51,But I have a grand heart and a soft touch.
goodnight51,Love and affection will without doubt dwindle the oxidation.
goodnight51,These were my precise thoughts.
goodnight51,My precise thoughts however happened to be counterfactual.
goodnight51,It was not a sea of love I was falling into.
goodnight51,I took a heart felt leap, then down I went into the beasts inferno.
goodnight51,The quandary of the inferno is once your in there is no departure.
goodnight51,The beasts paradox not even a match for Zeno.
goodnight51,Torrid is the mind once in the inferno.
goodnight51,Trepidation sets in paralysis.
goodnight51,When there is no way to run the next logical step is to please.
goodnight51,Laboring no longer for love, not even for kindness, laboring for a break.
goodnight51,The harder you labor the more you give the beast to bite.
goodnight51,Eventually you give way losing sprit.
goodnight51,All that is left is a pocket sized glint of hope that the beast will see his winning and perhaps even treat you as a prize.
goodnight51,Ah but you see this is wide in error.
goodnight51,The beast does not choose to reward his prize not even with small acts to make you feel human.
goodnight51,The beast does not stop.
goodnight51,Screams only fuel his embers, begging only brings lashings.
goodnight51,“Please let me go, I want to go home now.”
goodnight51,“You are home.” says the beast.
goodnight51,

goodnight70,
goodnight70,    Way down deep under the ocean in the deeps darkest corner of my mind there is cave full of never ender fire of blue and the emerald.
goodnight70,I found this place of wonder shortly after my death.
goodnight70,When I awoke I could smell something different in the air, something strange and cunning.
goodnight70,My blood felt like poison and I liked it.
goodnight70,What a gift a true and unusual gift to bequeath.
goodnight70,Somethin unholy was in the water which I have passed through and retained.
goodnight70,Could this be am I alive have I finally discovered the unsafe feeling of freedom I have always only visited in theory.
goodnight70,Beyond the fire there is no end, no beginning, no light nor darkness.
goodnight70,There only is what is what I can not begin to put into words.
goodnight70,though I can explain the feeling.
goodnight70,Like violent crashing waves of calmness.
goodnight70,The blinding sight that made my body shiver to coma and rocked me to a storm like no other storm before.
goodnight70,This storm was yellow and bright and retained no light.
goodnight70,Silly isn’t it color with out light.
goodnight70,That’s not even possible and yet it happened I can see it now still with my own three eyes.
goodnight70,Burning me with salt and ice.
goodnight70,A burn I would beg for a burn untold of always to be seen.
goodnight70,They say the eyes are the windows of the soul.
goodnight70,Oh but how wrong one can be.
goodnight70,Eyes are only eyes and nothing more.
goodnight70,You can see the emotion around the skin as they wrinkle in a smile or tear in woe and joy.
goodnight70,You can even see the gleam HALLEUJAH HALLEUJAH!!!
goodnight70,in victory of shocking gain and excitement.
goodnight70,Still these are only emotions.
goodnight70,The soul is beyond emotion, beyond good and evil, light and dark.
goodnight70,There are no old souls or new souls.
goodnight70,The soul is not man.
goodnight70,Man has created time.
goodnight70,The soul knows no time.
goodnight70,The soul is timeless.
goodnight70,The soul has always been and always will be.
goodnight70,
