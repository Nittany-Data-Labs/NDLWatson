goodnight68,I want to give up my house and all my things and become a couch surfer.
goodnight68,I want to shoot up a bunch of meth so I never pass out so I never have to dream.
goodnight68,I want fuck men who don’t want to love or to hold me because I cant have the one who I want to love and hold me.
goodnight68,I want to wonder the streets at 3am only caring about one thing and that’s to score some dope.
goodnight68,I want to not be concerned about anything but how drunk I can get.
goodnight68,I want to ruin my brain with drugs so I don’t have to think anymore.
goodnight68,I want to leave panties in strange mens beds and call business men daddy when they buy me drinks.
goodnight68,I want to throw out my name and my number and become no one.
goodnight68,I want to steal all my clothes from the goodwill and not shower for days on end.
goodnight68,grow a bush under each arm and walk around looking like I have a fruby in a head lock.
goodnight68,ill stop wearing deodorant and  loose a few teeth due to the meth.
goodnight68,I want to kill my self right now so bad the thoughts scare me.
goodnight68,
goodnight76,
goodnight76,     I took a bit of the sun.
goodnight76,Surprisingly Is wasn’t as hot as one would think.
goodnight76,delectable
goodnight76,scrumptious
goodnight76,I am chlorophyll
goodnight76,Organs thrive
goodnight76,MY organs thrive
goodnight76,Release and consume.
goodnight76,I am honey I am pollen
goodnight76,Pulling and drawing
goodnight76,breathing,
goodnight76, scream at the cut
goodnight76,healing  from the blade,
goodnight76,I have eaten the Sun,
goodnight76,I gave it back
goodnight76,Again.
goodnight76, 
goodnight76,
goodnight67,
goodnight67,     I can feel it now.
goodnight67,I am nothing but a shell of who I once was.
goodnight67,I cant keep him any longer.
goodnight67,not like this.
goodnight67,He is hurting, more then hurting me.
goodnight67,He is ripping me apart.
goodnight67,I cant live like this any longer.
goodnight67,Every think he says to me rips me apart.
goodnight67,I am walking on egg shells.
goodnight67,I love him for who he once was but this has gotten to the point I am afraid of him.
goodnight67,There is no being told that I am beautiful.
goodnight67,There is no being told thanks I did a good job or that I am loved or respected.
goodnight67,There are no more sweet nothings or holding hands.
goodnight67,All there is is abuse.
goodnight67,I am slipping away now.
goodnight67,last night I took the wrong turn on the way home.
goodnight67,I should have taken the quicker.
goodnight67,He just screamed and screamed “How could you be so retarded,  your worthless, dumb cunt, I hate how you drive, you ruined every ones night....” It just kept going on and on until I started throwing up all over my self and my fresh washed car.
goodnight67,After I pulled over covered in my own puke he got out of the car yelled some more things at me and the walked home leaving me alone covered in my own puke on the side of the road.
goodnight67,Today I didn’t make the eggs dry enough for break fast, then I didn’t pick out the right clothes to wear, I had my heat up to high and he was hot, I hid in the bedroom to get away from the yelling then I was being lazy laying around and doing nothing.
goodnight67,I didn’t say the right thing at the store, my house wasn’t clean enough, I tried to be sexy and put on something hot I had bought to surprise him but he said he didn’t like it, I tried to tell him I was hurt and how I felt but he just said he didn’t want to hear me bitch and I was being annoying nagging him.
goodnight67,Eventually after more screaming at me he stormed out of the house and now here I am.
goodnight67,I am not even crying this time.
goodnight67,I feel numb.
goodnight67,I cant take it anymore.
goodnight67,I know I am better then this and I would be better alone then abused.
goodnight67,I need to get back to being my self.
goodnight67,So I am choosing now to lift my self up and considering my self as of now under construction.
goodnight67,I just cant go on like this anymore.
goodnight67,
goodnight72,
goodnight72,I hate you.
goodnight72,I hate you for all the times you abused me and made me out to be the crazy one when I started to cry.
goodnight72,I hate the broken bones and bruises.
goodnight72,I hate your lies.
goodnight72,Your so selfish it makes me sick.
goodnight72,I hate how you never listen to me.
goodnight72,I hate when I poor my heart out to you and you say “what’s your point?”
goodnight72,   I should let you go.
goodnight72,I should have left you long ago.
goodnight72,I never turned you in when I should have.
goodnight72,Instead I lie and say I fell down the stairs.
goodnight72,I defend you  “it was really all my fault” “I had it coming” I love you so.
goodnight72,I love your smell, our thoughts every thing about you.
goodnight72,your killing me.
goodnight72,Why cant you just be good to me?
goodnight72,You say intentions don’t matter so I allow my self to think maybe I’m not doing a good enough job.
goodnight72,I give you all I have to give so much I don’t even know how I do it.
goodnight72,you say trying doesn’t count so I allow my self to think he is right I need to do a better job.
goodnight72,I love you and treat you like a king as I am always walking on egg shells.
goodnight72,You punish me and blame me for your own mistakes.
goodnight72,I tell people how much I care about you and how great you are as I am wearing sun glasses to cover my black eyes.
goodnight72,My life is falling apart and I want all this pain to end and I know  it will not unless I leave you for good.
goodnight72,One of the worst ways you abuse me is pretending to leave me and then act like I’m the one crawling back to you when you know you really never left me in the first place.
goodnight72,I threat to never see me again if I don’t do what you want but in the end you always see me the next day or two and I say I’m sorry for the mess you created and blamed on me.
goodnight72,I need to stop all this I need to let myself get this farce idea of you out of my head.
goodnight72,I look at you like a God when the truth is you are just an abuser.
goodnight72, 
goodnight72,
goodnight48,
goodnight48,     What is wrong with me that I keep putting my self through this?
goodnight48,I keep telling my self I am leaving and not going back.
goodnight48,I always go back.
goodnight48,Yet again I have another bruise.
goodnight48,This time was even more scary.
goodnight48,I couldn’t even stand to look at him whit his hands around my neck.
goodnight48,What if he didn’t let go when he did?
goodnight48,Does he have it in me to kill me?
goodnight48,At one time I would have thought of course not, Now I am not so sure anymore.
goodnight48,I just feel so stupid I cry and I cry and scream begging him to stop.
goodnight48,I just want it all to stop.
goodnight48,I feel so stupid.
goodnight48,What the hell is wrong with me?
goodnight48,I am a smart woman.
goodnight48,I know the abuse will not stop.
goodnight48,It will only get worse.
goodnight48,How much worse can it get before I am back in the ER with a broken bone lying to a doctor about falling down the steps or even worse dead.
goodnight48,
goodnight56,
goodnight56,      I had had plans tonight, nothing too special just a 5$ concert that I can honestly go either way on but the point is I had plans.
goodnight56,It was at 7pm.
goodnight56,So at 4pm I had on my dress and my makeup on all perfect and was ready to go at 6:15.
goodnight56,I always get ready and leave early because of my abnormal fear of being late.
goodnight56,Then close to 5pm I was notified that plans have changed.
goodnight56,Not only did plans change with us not going but plans also changed with my boyfriend being able to come over tonight turns out he has to make a deadline for work and is going to stay at his place tonight instead of mine because he has to use his computer to do the project.
goodnight56,UGH!!!
goodnight56,What a nightmare!!!!!
goodnight56,Its not that I am mad at him or feel like I need to see him that bad or that I really wanted to go to the concert its just that the plans changed.
goodnight56,When plans change or things don’t go as expected I can have a very hard time dealing with it.
goodnight56,Being an ASPI switching focus can be challenging.
goodnight56,Yes I am a grown woman and I will and do get over it but its still hard.
goodnight56,I try not to act out or have a melt down which usually consist of crying or trying to figure out how to make something still work that wont work things like that lol nothing dangerous but still crappy.
goodnight56,Still though I feel panic.
goodnight56,Being an adult with adult responsibilities I have to manage the panic very carefully.
goodnight56,I will do deep breathing and try to find something else to focus on but truth is I still feel the great upset and the only thing that I can do is just suck it up deal with being upset and get over it which could take minutes or hours or maybe till the next day.
goodnight56,I am feeling it now but I am okay it just really sucks.
goodnight56,So I told him “good night” which is my code for I’m not mad at you but I may get upset with you even though its not your fault so I am giving my self time to get over it and feel better.
goodnight56,then he said, “ill see you in the morning” I then asked what time and I got 8am out of him.
goodnight56,I cant stand when I don’t know an exact time frame it drives me bonkers!
goodnight56,I hate not knowing things!!!!!!
goodnight56,I deal with it when I have to but I try to always know what plans are what times and things like that.
goodnight56,If I say go to a party then in my head I will also plan what time I think I will leave when it gets close to that time I start to get antsy.
goodnight56,Say if I am at the party with him and its close to time to go but he is not getting ready to go yet and I ask him how much longer and he says “i don’t know” this makes me feel very uneasy.
goodnight56,“to me I don’t know” means could be in one minute or it could be forever.
goodnight56,I need at to know at lest a ball park range to feel okay.
goodnight56,for example it is easier for me to deal with between 8pm and 10pm.
goodnight56, 
goodnight56,
goodnight55,
goodnight55,    Ted woke up at 6:42am wondering where the cat was that shit in his mouth.
goodnight55,Ted always set his alarm for slightly strange times like 6:47, 6:51....
goodnight55,This way Ted figured he would be to tired to work out the proper math in his head to know if he could push snooze or not and would be forced to just get up.
goodnight55,Ted brushes his teeth for what feels like forever but is actually only about 30 seconds.
goodnight55,In Teds closet there are 7 pairs of brown pants and 7 white collared button up dress shirts and 7 tan ties.
goodnight55,Ted doesn’t care about style and figures this routine makes his life simple and easy to manage.
goodnight55,Ted only buys new clothes when his old ones are no longer adequate and he buys the same close from the same online store every time.
goodnight55,Ted also figures that He saves about 30 hours a year not having to shop in stores looking for the perfect outfits and sorting laundry.
goodnight55,After putting on his brown pants white shirt and tan tie Ted drops his red plaid pajamas (which he also has exactly 7 pairs of)  into the hamper.
goodnight55,Ted now takes a long look in the bathroom mirror and wonders if he hadn’t worn hats during his youth if he would still have hair.
goodnight55,However this thought is pointless because Ted does not have hair.
goodnight55,Ted eats a simple bowl of cheerios for breakfast.
goodnight55,His chewing sounds likes grinding rocks and slightly bothers him but Ted gets over it and eats his cheerios all the same.
goodnight55,Ted never drinks the milk he dumps it down the sink  washes the bowl and the spoon dries with a towel and puts away directly after he is done.
goodnight55,This way upon his arrival home from work at 5:30pm his apartment will feel clean, warm and inviting.
goodnight55,Ted has two pairs of shoes both black slip on dress shoes.
goodnight55,Ted slips on the his work pair grabs his briefcase and walks out the door at precisely  7:35.
goodnight55,This gives Ted 20 minutes to get to work because 5 minutes early is on time.
goodnight55,Ted only lives 10 minutes from his office but figures an extra five minutes for traffic.
goodnight55,If there happens to be little to no traffic Ted will get to work early and simply wait in his car.
goodnight55,Ted gets out of his car at 7:53 which gives him one minute to enter the building and one extra minute incase a passing coworker or stranger stops to say hello and there for he is obligated to say hello back.
goodnight55,This insures Ted will arrive at work at exactly 7:55am which is just on time.
goodnight55,This is Teds morning.
goodnight55,Teds morning has not changed for the last 20 years and 257 days.
goodnight55,
goodnight64,
goodnight64,“Babar?”, “Babar are you here?”
goodnight64,“Yes my dear I am here... well sorta.”
goodnight64,“sorta?” “Babar you have me confused.”

goodnight64,“Babar what ever do you mean?”

goodnight78,
goodnight78,   I realize that most people tell about them selves in there first entry how ever my hands have a mind of there own and seemed to have other plans.
goodnight78,So here we go about ME ME ME!!!!!!
goodnight78,Most people would say I am eccentric.
goodnight78,I would have to agree with this statement being that I do live in a small 8×9 foot bubble under the sea with of course my 24 foot pet dragon which can at times be dreadfully annoying with his awful snoring habits and all but hey I can complain much he is the one who has to put up with my horrid morning breath!
goodnight78,Oh and then of course I have two wild heathens who follow me around everywhere I go named Sambo and Woeden .
goodnight78,Such helpless little savages.
goodnight78,They get up dreadfully early and don’t stop nagging with there high pitched shrieks until I at last allow them to lick the earwax from the previous days Qtips.
goodnight78,so Eccentric..?
goodnight78,Yes I find this quit fitting.
goodnight78,My favorite is yellow.
goodnight78,In fact I like yellow so much I have even taken it upon my self to harvest 26 rittleboppers from the earth and name them all Yellow.
goodnight78,In case you don’t know what a rittlebopper is here is the definition,
goodnight78,Rittleopper- A small animal like plant that sorta looks like a tiny thingordoodle on the third day of the 9 settings sun and lives for exactly 891 years and 3 days while crying tears of joy the whole time in a pitch too low for the human ear to hear and only eats green lima beans every 3erd sunday.
goodnight78,I also Like to play the piano.
goodnight78,I once composed a song so great I got the honor of playing for the queen of wombonboo and her 72 cousins.
goodnight78,Afterwards we all had tea.
goodnight78,So there is a little about me if you would like to know anything else please just ask
goodnight78, 
goodnight78,
goodnight58,
goodnight58,       Almighty empress am I.
goodnight58,Down bellow the billowing winds and rays of light projected through grains of glass created from my sands.
goodnight58,Little specks of truth handed down like an old kings soul.
goodnight58,She did not notice.
goodnight58,Truth be told neither did I.
goodnight58,He didn’t breathe, there was no need.
goodnight58,Stories outline the maps we look at every day which only becomes visible after dark.
goodnight58,Midnight magic causes cramp.
goodnight58,Dreary dwells the sound.
goodnight58,Hushing for the sake of the baby.
goodnight58,The sounds of the whom.
goodnight58,A sarcophagus nailed shut keeps the pressure.
goodnight58,Let it be my dear let it be.
goodnight58,Sakes are short, lines wiggle; with this candle life is simple.
goodnight58,Adventure is simple, a grand expedition easy does it.
goodnight58,No need to see the end.
goodnight58,It doesn’t matter.
goodnight58,Grave warnings, giggling groups of fish.
goodnight58,“Where did my head go?” “did you check under the bed?” I did I did it wasn’t there” “how about behind the door?” “oh no my silly Babar I only leave it there Friday and Tuesday nights.” “oh well I suppose my head has a mind of its own, it will show up when its ready.” “oh goodness I do declare how preposterous of me!
goodnight58,it is not my head I have lost for it was here the whole time.
goodnight58,No no I am afraid it is my body that seems to have gone missing” “you mean it just grew legs and walked away?” “perhaps or maybe just slithered in its usual way” “no need to fret a quick trip to the store and I shall have another.”
goodnight58,
goodnight74,
goodnight74,    Beckon for me I want to hear the scream faint as a wispier.
goodnight74,Call upon me to beg for your fire.
goodnight74,Wash me of my sins and watch me dance in the presents of your sent.
goodnight74,This glory will not come again.
goodnight74,I would be a fool not bow nor sing thy name.
goodnight74,I could smell it on you from the day we met.
goodnight74,Your edge so sharp like a diamond.
goodnight74,I didn’t need to ask who and what you were.
goodnight74,life is a returnable gift.
goodnight74,As far as I know a gift I did not ask for.
goodnight74,Life it is like unwrapping from the goodwill it could be super cool and exactly what you wanted of it could be shit.
goodnight74,Sometimes its good but you don’t notice because of all the other gifts (lives) you get caught up in and yours gets pushed to the side and sometimes you so see how great it is and are so glad its all yours that you want to do one of two things keep it all to your self or share it with someone maybe even the world, then there are the bad gifts.
goodnight74,some bad gifts you can rearrange into something great or if you cant rearrange totally into something great you may find someone or a few maybe a lot who will share pieces of there gift with you till you have enough to add it to your reinventing it with your new pieces to make great.
goodnight74,then there are the gifts that are so shitty that you can not rearrange them into anything better at all and its so bad that others wont come close enough to your gift to share there.
goodnight74,the other shitty gifts my hang around your shitty gift but that usually just makes a bigger pile of shit.
goodnight74,so what kind of gift have I got... honestly I am not really sure nor am I sure when it will be returned but like all gifts good and bad they all sooner or latter got returned rather you return by choice lose it or just parish leaving it behind to be forgotten it may take a long time but nothing last forever.
goodnight74,Some day we will not recall the name Ann Frank or even Jesus Christ.
goodnight74,You can argue the point all you want but it is only your fear of loss that will be speaking and you own silly little prides which also in the end mean nothing.
goodnight74, 
goodnight74,

goodnight65,     How strange, someone has wrote in my journal.
goodnight65,You would think I would be mad but I’m not.
goodnight65,In a way its interesting and creepy all at the same time.
goodnight65,I thought about changing my password but you know what?
goodnight65,I am not going to.
goodnight65,I sorta liked the excitement.
goodnight65,Feel fee to write in my journal again who ever you are.
goodnight65,
goodnight63,
goodnight63,    I lost Tia.
goodnight63,She was here about 8 months ago, haven’t seen here sense.
goodnight63,
goodnight71,
goodnight71,     Dear Jebus why do I love this ?
goodnight71,He is hurting me so bad.
goodnight71,I get away for small amounts of time by writing and playing my piano and bass but the issue is always still there.
goodnight71,He is hurting me.
goodnight71,Sure we have our good times which is I guess why I stay but deep down I know this cant be worth it.
goodnight71,He is crazy too crazy even for me.
goodnight71,Why is the though of me being with out him so hard to take?
goodnight71,Every time I say will be the last time but I always go back.
goodnight71,I hate having to come up with a new lie every time it happens.
goodnight71,“I slipped in the shower and broke my arm.”, “I ran into a door and broke my nose.”, “I tripped down my stairs and got a concussion and two black eyes.” these are just some of the things I said knowing fully they are all lies.
goodnight71,Its not just the bruises and broken bones though its even more then that.
goodnight71,Its being called retarded and a cunt it being yelled at in the car for taking a different way then he wanted to take.
goodnight71,Its being invited over to his place only to have him treat me like crap till I start to cry and then him tell me to get out and go home that he doesn’t want me there.
goodnight71,Its so hard to believe how he can do these things to me and yet other days be the best man I have ever had slow dancing with me and taking off my jacket when we go to dinner.
goodnight71,We have pretty much every thing in common even the really odd things I thought I  would never find in anyone but me.
goodnight71,anti religious anti military hates cops and loves are and music in odd forms most unheard of.
goodnight71,He even asked me to merry him I said yes.
goodnight71,Now that all seems not to matter so much because the bad is out weighing the good ten fold.
goodnight71,I feel so ugly and so worthless around him all the time now.
goodnight71,I have to stop this some how I have to get away.
goodnight71,I am a smart woman I know it is better to be alone then be abused but why do I feel so inlove to him I just cant go.
goodnight71,I always do anything for him he asks me to do no questions.
goodnight71,I follow him anywhere and am always cleaning up his shit.
goodnight71,I thought if I could be good enough to him he would see that and start being good t me like he used to be but I realize now it is him not me.
goodnight71,There is nothing I could do or say to change things now it will only get worse.
goodnight71,He will not listen or care about what I have to say.
goodnight71,He will not wake up and think oh shit she is gone I need to change... been there done that.
goodnight71,He will treat me the way he wants and  I cant change that.
goodnight71,This feeling is so shitty and I want it to go away.
goodnight71,I need t be my strong self I was before I met him not this empty shell of a person I have become.
goodnight71,I know that I should be with someone who makes me feel beautiful and wanted who does not his me or call me names or kicks me out when he is drunk.
goodnight71,So why is it so hard then!?
goodnight71,It has gotten to the point where no one even believes the lies and I have lost all my friends and even my own mother called bs on me the last time I told “I fell down” it broke my heart hearing her say “I already buried one baby and cant bare to burry another”.
goodnight71,So now I just lie and say to her that we broke up and don’t visit her if I have an injury I cant cover with clothes or make up.
goodnight71,I feel like my heart has been ripped out and burned at the stake.
goodnight71,I am such a smart girl I really am so why am I doing this to my self?
goodnight71,Its so stupid how I agree with him every time he hurts me that its my fault.
goodnight71,I know damn well him catching me smoking a cigarette is no reason to get hit or me telling him my period is late is no reason to get hit by his car but I do agree I say its my fault and tell him I am sorry I caused him to hurt me so we can just get over it and he can be happy and pleased and we can move on.
goodnight71,The first time it happened he gave me two black eves and a bloody lip he felt so bad the next day he even cried and I though he would never do it again but I was wrong and what is even worse he as never told me he was sorry or showed me any remorse again.
goodnight71,I feel like I am nothing but trash to him so I try even harder to treat him like a king.
goodnight71,I am to good for him anyone could see that.
goodnight71,I just have to mentally find a way out of this.
goodnight71,
goodnight57,

goodnight57,I am extremely loyal and honest.
goodnight57,lying and being not being faithful is something my mind just does not process very well.
goodnight57,I feel so proud of my self at times.
goodnight57,Me the little blond mute girl that all through growing up people treated so fragile, Me that girl that her family planned on me never moving away from home having a family of my own and an education.

goodnight57,I have a car and pay my own bills.
goodnight57,But not only did I prove everyone wrong I have went beyond that.
goodnight57,I am more put together than most mothers my age at all.
goodnight57,I do need help with somethings still and I do get it when it is needed but the way I see it is everything needs help with something and hey I drive my own car and provide for my own family and beyond.

goodnight66,    The truth is I am okay.
goodnight66,I may not feel like it most of the time as of lately but I am okay.
goodnight66,I have been through hell and back and Here I am I am still here.

goodnight66,I have a car to drive.
goodnight66,I have my art and my music.

goodnight66,I am a good honest person.

goodnight66,
goodnight50,
goodnight50,     I often hear people saying they have no filter and will say whatever they want because there not fake.
goodnight50,Its not being “fake” its called being a mature adult with morals and values... Not sure how you people were raised but where I come from if you don’t have anything nice to say then don’t say anything at all.
goodnight50,Sure if you need to stand up for your self to a bully or something that you believe in that’s one thing.
goodnight50,However if you are just going around being rude and hurting feelings then try and keep that to your self.
goodnight50,Sometimes I make a mistake and say something rude and not even notice and if it is pointed out to me I will apologize no problem.
goodnight50,Accidents happen but there is no good reason to be hurtful and mean on purpose.
goodnight50,And further more even if you were not raised to use curtesy and respect as a grown adult you should be able to use basic human sense and figure it out.
goodnight50,Its not rocket science to be nice to others.
goodnight50,Also the people I always hear saying this never say things with tact.
goodnight50,For example there is a difference between saying privately to some one “Hey I just thought you should know your makeup is not blended very well and it is obvious.” and then there is this out loud in front of others, ” your face doesn’t match your neck!”  see what I mean you can say the same thing nicely or you could be very hurtful.
goodnight50,So just because you “don’t have a filter because you are not fake” does not give you a free pass to be an ass!
goodnight50,and that’s my rant for the day, lol off my soap box now.
goodnight50,By the way this entry is not about anyone in particular its just something I hear a lot that really annoys me.
goodnight50,
goodnight75,
goodnight75,    I hate when I question what our troops are fighting for and they say our “freedom”.
goodnight75,People seem to get safety and freedom mixed up.
goodnight75,Yes in America we a safer from many things other countries are not, except pollution, obesity, unhealthy food and poverty of course.
goodnight75,However America is not free.
goodnight75,I am not an asshole I am just simply looking at the cold hard facts.
goodnight75,America I number one in three things, obesity, incarceration and laws.
goodnight75,Yes you heard me correctly America “the land of the free’ has more laws then any other country.
goodnight75,on the list of freest countries in the world America does not even make in the list of top ten in fact we are way down at number 20!!!
goodnight75,I am not saying you can not be grateful to live here or have to be “anti-American” but at least look at and admit the truth.
goodnight75,America is not a free country or the land of the free.
goodnight75,America is one of the most heavily patrolled countries in the would proving quit the opposite of freedom.
goodnight75,Stop blindly believing what ever you are told do some fair honest studying on both sides of the fence and also look around you using common sense and your own mind.
goodnight75,Sure we may feel safe here and no one is getting burned at the steak for being gay “thank God!” but we are not as free as you think you know as you are taught.
goodnight75,Sometimes in order to gain freedom one must give up safety.
goodnight75,I would make the payment of possible safety for true freedom and others would not.
goodnight75,either choice is okay equally okay.
goodnight75,All I am asking is lets just be honest about it.
goodnight75,
goodnight49,
goodnight49,Seraphric affection,
goodnight49,Rogue Sovereign,
goodnight49,For who I have marked time loyally before your coming.
goodnight49,Upon arrival of you particular lure.
goodnight49,Madcapped benevolence swept though this vessel.
goodnight49,Electric regards  for my knight fell apace.
goodnight49,Oh how all Gods in heaven shall never dissever our hearts that bind beyond time and space.
goodnight49, 
goodnight49, 
goodnight49,

goodnight59,
goodnight59,      I have two young kids, I love them deeply and like most other mothers want the to grow up intelligent, wise and destined for great things.
goodnight59,I also know that creativity and imagination is the cornerstone for this.
goodnight59,Without creativity the world would not and will not progress.
goodnight59,Sadly most adults have lost all imagination.
goodnight59,I am talking about having the ability to wonder, to think outside of your world and what is happing right now.
goodnight59,The ability to not only retain information of what is taught to you by others but to create your own thoughts and ideas.
goodnight59,Schools teach our kids the alphabet and how to counts to 100.
goodnight59,They teach how to identify colors and shapes.
goodnight59,These are all things they will learn in life rather we try to teach them these things or not.
goodnight59,Schools also teach, glue the white cotton balls on the sheep, color inside of the lines, water is blue and fish live inside of the water and birds fly in the sky.
goodnight59,I WILL NOT TEACH MY KIDS TO COLOR INSIDE THE LINES!!!!!
goodnight59,Teaching a child to color inside of the lines takes away there creativity.
goodnight59,Creativity is curtail to the human race and our life as we know it.
goodnight59,To take away ones creativity is to take away there intelligence.
goodnight59,As a whole we are raising our children to become artificial life forms not unique intelligent individuals to progress the forward movement of the earth.
goodnight59,I WILL TEACH MY CHILDREN there art is beautiful inside and outside of the lines.
goodnight59,I will teach my children that it is okay to imagine water can be purple fish can fly and birds life under the sea.
goodnight59,As adults we should try live this way as well.
goodnight59,To think and create for our selves.
goodnight59,What if I wake up tomorrow and a magical fairy with pink butterfly wings spits fire into my soul and I then become a mermaid?
goodnight59,Sound silly?
goodnight59,well its not.
goodnight59,It is important and intelligent to think like this.
goodnight59,Come on people are we forgetting the world is full of infinite possibilities.
goodnight59,Answering questions right or wrong is not the most important thing.
goodnight59,Asking questions is the most important thing.   
goodnight59,
goodnight77,
goodnight77,   As our fight went down to the river still we never prayed.
goodnight77,Now its come down to this fist to face I wont let you win.
goodnight77,He wont let me win.
goodnight77,Baby you have broke my heart and ate me whole.
goodnight77,now where do we go from here when we both don’t go.
goodnight77,down in the river where we never pray.
goodnight77,I love with all my might.
goodnight77,That will never charge.
goodnight77,You try and say I am the one that’s real however now I know this is only a gas light.
goodnight77,I love you so much I will hurt you and hurt my self.
goodnight77,If we both cant win I will not give the submission only runs to the point of dream and now I have seen where the is no light.
goodnight77,that is not a dream but stupid little thing bigger than the both of us.
goodnight77,Now I cant think to speak how long you waited for this day.
goodnight77,I bet you think that thing will go your way.
goodnight77,You are always wrong.
goodnight77,You tried to run away I held you down with my own arms this your force broke me again and the I ran away where you found tied to the tub pulling me away.
goodnight77,It was only a joke when you cried out in pain.
goodnight77,selfish deeds and using me will only bread more shit.
goodnight77,How can you not see how your always wrong.
goodnight77,I wont let you go even when you run Ill be a punching bag before you can leave the scene.
goodnight77,Don’t you lie and say you wont love me.
goodnight77,Don’t you be a fool again to say your leaving me only to return again.
goodnight77,Don’t you think I have learned by now these are only words and you are to go I’m right behind you as you pretend your running for me you only just fast enough for me to trip on your shoe.
goodnight77,no you will never go.
goodnight77,if I drown you drown too.
goodnight77,so what if I am dark so what if I am crazy.
goodnight77,ill eat you whole you will live inside of me.
goodnight77,I got my fork and iv got my knife ready to jump inside my self after you.
goodnight77,you chase me away to grasp my hair and drag me back.
goodnight77,I push you out until you agree to go and then board up your walls you are never leaving me again.
goodnight77,
goodnight69,
goodnight69,  My cement high-rise, Inside I swelter,
goodnight69,tick, tick, a slaves time is to slow for a tock
goodnight69,Looking out this bay of plexi down on to the armored ants honking and beeping
goodnight69,with no time for a tock there is certainly no time to spare for the numbskull in front who ignores changing lights with heavy eyes.
goodnight69,Quick, slick, loafers swift drift alarm the daydreamer back to drudge
goodnight69,Tap, Tap, Tap an endless see of taps and the a space.
goodnight69,tap, tap, space, enter.
goodnight69,Jazz Jiving servitude,
goodnight69,until just one final..
goodnight69,TICK!
goodnight69,A slight smirk of jubilance
goodnight69,Back to MY own armored ant and then MY hut in which where I collect MY keep
goodnight69,ZZZZZZZZZ.......
goodnight69,BUZZZZZ
goodnight69,Armored ant, cement high-rise, porthole, drudge, Jazz Jive, TICK, armored ant, zzzzzzz, buzz
goodnight69,Perplexed

goodnight53,
goodnight53,      Winters death is near.
goodnight53,Its a beautiful and gloomy day.
goodnight53,Its about to rain I can smell it, one of my favorite scents.
goodnight53,So this morning I have opened all the windows of my home.
goodnight53,As I feel the fresh wind  blowing through the house and the seasons changing I can feel my life changing as  well.
goodnight53,In the last month I have lost 22 lbs then for the last few days I have messed up.
goodnight53,I am going to think of the last few days as just a simple break from my life style and get back on it today.
goodnight53,We all need a break sometimes right?
goodnight53,
goodnight61,
goodnight61,    So I run an in-home daycare.
goodnight61,I actually went to school to be a preschool teacher but then found out I make much better money running a daycare from my home especially because then I don’t have to pay for my kids daycare this way while I am working.
goodnight61,I will never get rich of off an in-home daycare but I am okay with that.
goodnight61,We have more than enough and I am happy.
goodnight61,Its funny with my tattoos and abstract writing and other things about me I don’t think a lot of people would expect me to be one to work with kids.
goodnight61,But I do and I love it.
goodnight61,Honestly I don’t think I would love anything else as much as I do teaching and working with children.
goodnight61,Teaching preschoolers has always been my what I wanted to do when I grew up.
goodnight61,I am lucky to be one of the few people that can say I am what I wanted to be when I grew up.
goodnight61,I am good at what I do so its pretty easy to get customers for me.
goodnight61,I put together unique lesson plans.
goodnight61,We do not watch tv at all which is a great selling point for child care.
goodnight61,Every day we do art, music, reading and math or science.
goodnight61,I provide much healthier food then most daycares and I truly love being able to have just enough kids to be able to do group projects and games but also spend one on one time with each one.
goodnight61,To a point I also get to set my own hours and I love that lol who wouldn’t?!
goodnight61,SO ....
goodnight61,Todsay I have TWO new kids coming!!!!!!!
goodnight61,I am so excited!
goodnight61,I am wearing my favorite red long flowered dress to make a good impression and have plans to take them to the park across the street if it is nice enough. 
goodnight61,
goodnight52,
goodnight52,    words mean something and so did I. I didn’t go there and then I did.
goodnight52,I get it , I get what means.
goodnight52,Knowledge.
goodnight52,woe, Joy, I didn’t know, I didn’t know it was so great.
goodnight52,How did I become again.
goodnight52,Why did it start?
goodnight52,I have honestly the answers only ides, I how no ides.
goodnight52,
goodnight79,
goodnight79,     Mondays can be Dark however never as dark as a Sunday.
goodnight79,Bringing the blood thirsty beast out in the night.
goodnight79,Calling her calling her away from me.
goodnight79,Can it be Cant it really truly be?
goodnight79,How strange how easy parts of us can be so easily rapped and stolen away from us?
goodnight79,Where do these pieces go?
goodnight79,Perhaps in a sepulcher next to our masters bed.
goodnight79,Ah yes the master may choose the keep the dead pieces of they so wish to.
goodnight79,Master what a thoughtful name for such a thief however so fitting.
goodnight79,For if you allow one to take a piece of your inside meaningful or not you still have and there for they have mastered you.
goodnight79,After no one has ever said one must like its master.
goodnight79,Hell the Master doesn’t even have to feed.
goodnight79,Owners are not always so sweet as you may wish.
goodnight79,Sometimes they choose to let there own property die.
goodnight79,To watch it burn from the inside out.
goodnight79,Never a thought never even a question why.
goodnight79,To master a sheep you are a dog to master a dog you are a butcher and to master a butcher you are a boss to be worshiped by the strong and to eat the weak.
goodnight79,Desire holds it close and fear keeps it closer, that is if you are smart.
goodnight79,A dog will take his pray by force.
goodnight79,like all animals a dog is filth.
goodnight79,If you are to be mastered by an animal of such filth as a Dog maybe you should burn.
goodnight79,Maybe your ashes well smell better.
goodnight79,I God is cunning and sly.
goodnight79,A God will get what it wants before you even under stand that you are in the mouth of a monster.
goodnight79,If you can look into the mouth of a monster and still with all your heart beg to sit by his side for worship then you are the butcher.
goodnight79,
goodnight51,
goodnight51,     Smiles gleam so radiant.
goodnight51,A sliver tongue, so charming.
goodnight51,An electric touch sends surges through my body.
goodnight51,What a high!
goodnight51,His embrace of enchanting magic.
goodnight51,For the beast my regard quickly became rather tender.
goodnight51,How peculiarly drawn I was to the beast.
goodnight51,Even knowing that in fact he was indeed a beast.
goodnight51,My thoughts were positive.
goodnight51,I do have a beast and this beast loves and cares for me like no other flesh and blood man ever has.
goodnight51,Enlightened,  I was elated to have the privilege to belong to such a creature.
goodnight51,Who would have ever thought it would be me.
goodnight51,For once in my life I was the lucky one.
goodnight51,I was warned, I was  told by many to run and yet I stayed loyal by his side.
goodnight51,It was no matter to me if others were so blind as to not see my luck.
goodnight51,He was my God and beside him was I his queen and together just like that we would stay.
goodnight51,A beast is a beast I suppose.
goodnight51,I am a wise young gentlewoman.
goodnight51,I understood a beasts comes with beastly issues.
goodnight51,But I have a grand heart and a soft touch.
goodnight51,Love and affection will without doubt dwindle the oxidation.
goodnight51,These were my precise thoughts.
goodnight51,My precise thoughts however happened to be counterfactual.
goodnight51,It was not a sea of love I was falling into.
goodnight51,I took a heart felt leap, then down I went into the beasts inferno.
goodnight51,The quandary of the inferno is once your in there is no departure.
goodnight51,The beasts paradox not even a match for Zeno.
goodnight51,Torrid is the mind once in the inferno.
goodnight51,Trepidation sets in paralysis.
goodnight51,When there is no way to run the next logical step is to please.
goodnight51,Laboring no longer for love, not even for kindness, laboring for a break.
goodnight51,The harder you labor the more you give the beast to bite.
goodnight51,Eventually you give way losing sprit.
goodnight51,All that is left is a pocket sized glint of hope that the beast will see his winning and perhaps even treat you as a prize.
goodnight51,Ah but you see this is wide in error.
goodnight51,The beast does not choose to reward his prize not even with small acts to make you feel human.
goodnight51,The beast does not stop.
goodnight51,Screams only fuel his embers, begging only brings lashings.
goodnight51,“Please let me go, I want to go home now.”
goodnight51,“You are home.” says the beast.
goodnight51,

goodnight70,
goodnight70,    Way down deep under the ocean in the deeps darkest corner of my mind there is cave full of never ender fire of blue and the emerald.
goodnight70,I found this place of wonder shortly after my death.
goodnight70,When I awoke I could smell something different in the air, something strange and cunning.
goodnight70,My blood felt like poison and I liked it.
goodnight70,What a gift a true and unusual gift to bequeath.
goodnight70,Somethin unholy was in the water which I have passed through and retained.
goodnight70,Could this be am I alive have I finally discovered the unsafe feeling of freedom I have always only visited in theory.
goodnight70,Beyond the fire there is no end, no beginning, no light nor darkness.
goodnight70,There only is what is what I can not begin to put into words.
goodnight70,though I can explain the feeling.
goodnight70,Like violent crashing waves of calmness.
goodnight70,The blinding sight that made my body shiver to coma and rocked me to a storm like no other storm before.
goodnight70,This storm was yellow and bright and retained no light.
goodnight70,Silly isn’t it color with out light.
goodnight70,That’s not even possible and yet it happened I can see it now still with my own three eyes.
goodnight70,Burning me with salt and ice.
goodnight70,A burn I would beg for a burn untold of always to be seen.
goodnight70,They say the eyes are the windows of the soul.
goodnight70,Oh but how wrong one can be.
goodnight70,Eyes are only eyes and nothing more.
goodnight70,You can see the emotion around the skin as they wrinkle in a smile or tear in woe and joy.
goodnight70,You can even see the gleam HALLEUJAH HALLEUJAH!!!
goodnight70,in victory of shocking gain and excitement.
goodnight70,Still these are only emotions.
goodnight70,The soul is beyond emotion, beyond good and evil, light and dark.
goodnight70,There are no old souls or new souls.
goodnight70,The soul is not man.
goodnight70,Man has created time.
goodnight70,The soul knows no time.
goodnight70,The soul is timeless.
goodnight70,The soul has always been and always will be.

goodnight322,I’m going to make this quick tonight since I want to go to bed soon.
goodnight322,Nothing much special to write about just work and home.
goodnight322,Worked out on lunch break and skating after work.
goodnight322,It was good decision to go out skating.
goodnight322,It always makes me feel better.
goodnight322,Salad for dinner with some Indian bean dish that J made.
goodnight322,Had a bottle of beer and talked my mom and grand mom on the phone for about 30 mins.
goodnight322,I feel always sorry for my parent that I haven’t really gave them back anything yet.
goodnight322,Despite all the support I got from them.
goodnight322,Although I know they are good, I feel like I still owe them a lot including my sister and grand mom too.
goodnight322,This is the one of the reasons that I want to be success and give them back more than I received.
goodnight322,I just need to keep try and try to get things I want and get there where I want to be.
goodnight322,Yes, I gotta be more smart and work more harder cause I’m not even close yet.
goodnight322,I will never give up and one day I will get all of them!

goodnight386,who went to army with me and studying at Atlanta for Masters.
goodnight386,We talked about life in   general, career, school, family, future and marriage.

goodnight386,We both are still trying to move forward to get to the better place on our career and better place on out life.
goodnight386,Kind of feel like I have wasted all this time.
goodnight386,We talked about being at the right place at the right time and we ended up to the conclusion that we  haven’t been at the right place and the right time and we will be there someday soon if we keep try.
goodnight386,So here I am try to be positive and yes keep trying.
goodnight386,I will keep going regardless of result that I’m gonna get from it.

goodnight296,I think it is time for me to move on.
goodnight296,The girl I like does not seems to be on the same page as me and I don’t want to push her to do anything.
goodnight296,She already has a lot to take care of her own.
goodnight296,Sometimes you have to make a decision that you don’t really want but I do understand that it is inevitable sometimes.
goodnight296,At the end, I want her to be happy and so do I.
goodnight296,To do that, I’m going back to what it was before when I saw her for the first time when I only see her As friend and I believe it’s better for everybody around me.

goodnight404,It actually wasn’t a big deal.
goodnight404,I have been having that for years now.
goodnight404,However, every time when I get rejected for better opportunity that I want, I get frustrated little bit.
goodnight404,I just need to do something to get over it so I eat.

goodnight281,I feel like I have so many thoughts in my head and still not sure what’s the answer.
goodnight281,It can be very excited or very sad.
goodnight281,It will be all clear in a month or two but I know till then I won’t be able to get rid of all these thoughts.
goodnight281,Life is so unexpected even after all theses plans.
goodnight281,I guess I will just have to find the best way for me to go and try my best at the moment.
goodnight281,For now tho, I just wanna forget about everything and be relaxed. 
goodnight281,
goodnight422,
goodnight422,Woke up around 8am and craving porkchop for some reason with grape lol.
goodnight422,So I went ro grocery market got porkchop and grape.
goodnight422,I was confidence that I could cook porkchop really good as my friend cooked for me couple days ago cause I still have all the spices she picked up.
goodnight422,So I tried do the same as she did and it turned out ok visually but the taste was not the same.
goodnight422,I must missed something or put something else it doesn’t need.
goodnight422,I should have payed for attention when she cooked it.
goodnight422,Well it doesn’t tastes bad though.
goodnight422,We are having a beautiful sunny day here in chicago.
goodnight422,I will go out to lake for skating later for sure.
goodnight422,Today, I habe to finish up for the UI freelance stuff and ask for the price and take care of some of my websites.
goodnight422,Since I have couple other personal projects to keep up.
goodnight422,I don’t know what people usually do on easter weekend but I will just gonna have peaceful weekend like last night.

goodnight422,The picture above is the one my friend made and the one below is the one I made today.

goodnight276,
goodnight276,Because I can’t go to sleep and it’s driving me crazy!
goodnight276,I had a very typical day just like any other weekdays except for that I took a nap when I got home after work.
goodnight276,It was only few minutes and being lazy on the bed but it’s breaking my daily routine now.
goodnight276,I might fell asleep around 3 AM and wake up at same time.
goodnight276,I will go to work as tomorrow as usual and will feel sleepy and tired probably at the end of the day tomorrow.
goodnight276,Well I hate when it happens.

goodnight690,My second entry today, since I got bored at home cause John has no Internet here  only my cellphone has access to the Internet.
goodnight690,It’s been snowing all day n is so nasty everywhere makes me kind of miss Cali.
goodnight690,It was busy day for me did bunch of things  until now.
goodnight690,Well, now that I don’t really have anything to do makes me think about stupid things like what’s the most important thing in my life, what am I pursuing for ... Etc etc.. Can’t even describe what I’m thinking its just so messy n complicated.
goodnight690,Maybe I should just keep myself really busy for a while or take another vacation to somewhere to clear my head.
goodnight690,
goodnight695,
goodnight695,I been doing some research about keeping a journal n it got me thinking that why do I wanna write a journal.
goodnight695,For me, writing a journal makes me feel peaceful.
goodnight695,I usually have lots of thoughts in my head.
goodnight695,It’s so messy n unorganized.
goodnight695,About 10 mins of time I get to write a journal makes me to clear my head n organize things.
goodnight695,It also gives  me a chance  to look back n make better plans for tomorrow.
goodnight695,Even though, I don’t write down everything in my head on my journal.
goodnight695,Hope u get something out of writing a journal.
goodnight695,
goodnight464,
goodnight464,Having trouble going sleep now.
goodnight464,I have been trying to go to sleep for 30 mins but still fully awake.
goodnight464,My stomach is telling me to put some food in n my willpower trying fight against it.
goodnight464,I think I just have too many thoughts in my head right now like kind of fear from not knowing what is going to happen in the future?

goodnight327,It just has been same for pretty much everyday.
goodnight327,Little bit of struggling at work to explain about web development process because people just think website as Theme Forest themes and not realize how important to get the design customized on your product.
goodnight327,Well it’s kind of been my daily life at work anyways.
goodnight327,Always thinking for the ideas but so far no good.
goodnight327,Nothing really catches my mind and gets me excited.
goodnight327,I feel like I just need some break and this New York trip takes care of it hopefully.

goodnight319,I’m thinking back right now and this got me realize that I didn’t really do anything productive at all lately lol.
goodnight319,I always wanted to be lazy at home.
goodnight319,Now I remember that I did not even want to go out after work cause I felt lazy.
goodnight319,Yes this has to change.
goodnight319,I been always thinking tho that I want to do my own thing.
goodnight319,Always trying to get some ideas that I can put my passion into.
goodnight319,O don’t rush and open your mind more widely.
goodnight319,It will come to you if you keep looking for it!

goodnight434,By the time when I got home at 6:30 PM it was 55 degrees and I wanted to go run by the lake so bad since I saw all those people running around city on the way back home.
goodnight434,I changed to gym clothes and went out right away as soon as I got home.
goodnight434,Ran right to the lake and did run for about 5 miles.
goodnight434,I did exactly same route that I used to in last Summer.
goodnight434,There were lot of people running at the lake telling me the spring is coming.
goodnight434,I felt really good right now after taking a shower from running.
goodnight434,I can’t believe that I have forgotten about the this feeling for like 6 months.
goodnight434,It’s probably gonna get cold again tomorrow and snowing on Wednesday but I will see if I can go out and run.

goodnight394,I have been trying to get some ideas for this project for past couple days.
goodnight394,Did quite amount of research and tried to see what others have done.
goodnight394,However, some reason it did not really help me out so far.
goodnight394,Still not sure where I’m going to go with this.
goodnight394,I definitely need more research and planning before I actually get to work on it.
goodnight394,So today, I kind of planned out my protein deal menu very roughly.
goodnight394,Aiming for 60 gram of protein a day and I thinking I’m going to start with chicken breast.
goodnight394,One other thing about websites, thinking about getting two domains.
goodnight394,one for skate group and the other one for health blog.
goodnight394,Well we’ll see.
goodnight394,
goodnight294,
goodnight294,I found myself getting very irritated for this situation especially after driving almost an hour to get back to home and it’s hard to find street parking around here.
goodnight294,This does not happen often but when it happens... I just hate it.
goodnight294,Maybe I should just call the towing company but feel sorry to do that.
goodnight294,Well, I just don’t want to deal with this

goodnight337,I realized that I have things to do but don’t really know where to start.
goodnight337,I obviously need some time to sit down and writing down things I need to get done be priority to get the place I want to be.
goodnight337,I have been little just a little frustrated by not getting things that I have been trying for years which is fine cause I got used to it.
goodnight337,However, it sometimes becomes hard on me to accept that fact.
goodnight337,The bottom line is I never give up trying until I get that.
goodnight337,it’s 10:15pm here in Chicago.
goodnight337,The weather is still freezing and I’m still hoping/trying to get that thing I want  to do that I need a list of things that I need to do now to get that!

goodnight541,Just going sleep after having a big dinner myself.
goodnight541,How’s your night going?
goodnight541,
goodnight357,
goodnight357,like this weeks prayer of confession.
goodnight357,Sounds like something I would pray these days.
goodnight357,I’m sharing this here.
goodnight357,In our times of joy and our times of sorrow God is always present with us.
goodnight357,Let us turn now, together, to ask God to be with us even when we are at our most vulnerable.
goodnight357,Let us pray:
goodnight357,Ever present God, sometimes life doesn’t look like we want it to look.
goodnight357,We think if only we try harder, or pray more, or smile all day, or say just the right thing or look just the right way life will all come together and make sense.
goodnight357,But, it doesn’t.
goodnight357,Or it does.
goodnight357,Either way, it’s lonely.
goodnight357,Remind us that you are in this with us.
goodnight357,Broaden our ideas about healing so we can find you in the midst of our struggle.
goodnight357,Forgive our self-reliance.
goodnight357,Help us to see you.
goodnight357,Amen.

goodnight450,I cut my finger little bit last night when I cut onion while I was making dinner.
goodnight450,I got bandage on it all day and it was little annoying for me to do things I usually do like wash my hand lol.
goodnight450,Keep craving for something delicious to eat but I don’t know what.
goodnight450,Maybe it’s time for the seafood buffet.
goodnight450,Anyways, I’m going sleep goodnight!

goodnight598,
goodnight523,
goodnight523,I know I have to do something but I don’t know what that is.
goodnight523,keep trying to move forward without having a certain destination does not give me anything.
goodnight523,I think I really need some time to seat down and re-build my life plans.
goodnight523,Last time when I actually wrote down my life plans was like 5 years ago and since then lot of things changed.
goodnight523,so where to start?
goodnight523,lol
goodnight523,
goodnight420,
goodnight420,Maybe I have been trying to hide my real feelings.
goodnight420,Pretend to be happy all the time try to hide my weaknesses.
goodnight420,In fact that today I felt very depressed by no reason.
goodnight420,Just had same typical day but by the time when I got home I become all emotional all the sudden.
goodnight420,My cousin told me its coming from the weight loose thing that I’m doing (no food after 6pm) but I don’t thing that’s the reason but still have no idea why.
goodnight420,This happens quite amount of times lately.
goodnight420,I feel like I need to do something but don’t know what.
goodnight420,I just wanna fell asleep for now.
goodnight420,
goodnight462,
goodnight462,Well it’s been about 3 weeks or almost a month that I have been working on this project.
goodnight462,I still putting all my free time on this.
goodnight462,I was really frustrated for past week about the one technical thing that I failed to get a solution but tonight I made some improvement that possibly solve that problem eventually.
goodnight462,Looking back this week, I did not do much just working and my personal project.
goodnight462,Thinking about going bible study and volunteer work but I don’t know if I’m gonna make it.
goodnight462,For now I just want to get this project done.
goodnight462,I know there are gonna be more problems to solve but I will just take it step by step till I get what I want.
goodnight462,Goodnight everyone.
goodnight462,
goodnight274,
goodnight274,So since Anton got me back into iOS developer program, I decided to update iOS app for GoodnightJournal.com and I just uploaded new app to iTunes connect which will be reviewed by Apple people and will go on App Store eventually.
goodnight274,I’m using the new app to write this journal now and hoping it will work as I interned  Yes, I got lazy to test it properly before I submit it lol 
goodnight274,I just got a notification of completion for the process.
goodnight274,I have to go update all the art assets.
goodnight274,I feel very productive for doing this on Saturday night after a long day of skating 
goodnight274,Hope this will get more people to write journal here.
goodnight274,
goodnight469,
goodnight469,Dear Diary,
goodnight469,I had one of those typical day except for the freezing weather.
goodnight469,Work, work out on lunch break then home sitting at my computer like any other nights.
goodnight469,about to work on the project that I have been working on for couple weeks.
goodnight469,I think I found the information I need for that project so I gotta test it out.
goodnight469,Had too much food for dinner cause I feel uncomfortable to be sitting down on my chair lol.
goodnight469,I really have to reduce the amount of food that I am eating especially  for dinner.

goodnight368,
goodnight368,It’s been a while to write a journal here.
goodnight368,yes I have been very lazy and kind of busy.

goodnight368,Couldn’t really have time to look through all my projects and this site.
goodnight368,I know that I have to get back to it but just can’t get the time for this.
goodnight368,Maybe I’m not motivated enough now.
goodnight368,Well, I found this guy’s portfolio site today which actually got me motivated little bit.
goodnight368,His portfolio is so beautiful makes mind looks like a junk.
goodnight368,Now I see why I haven’t got a luck on all my attemptings.
goodnight368,Yes it’s time to get back to work!
goodnight368,Get motivated!!!
goodnight368,It has been raining all day.
goodnight368,Work was okay felt little slow all day.
goodnight368,Started work out for the triathlon training.
goodnight368,I biked for 7 miles and run/walk for 3 miles.
goodnight368,Realized that I’m so out of shape for such a intense cardio like that.
goodnight368,I have to work out regularly now on.
goodnight368,Not much going on.
goodnight368,Just typical stuffs with endless hope of something better...
goodnight368,Goodnight!

goodnight402,Well at least the weather was great!
goodnight402,

goodnight671,even last weekend, I had to run around to get furniture and stuff all day.
goodnight671,Today, I didn’t have to although my apartment obviously needs more furnitures  and some home goods, it’s good enough to live myself for now.

goodnight351,Just finished writing journal about an hour ago and trying to organize things that I couldn’t do over the weekend.
goodnight351,I think I got pretty much everything done.
goodnight351,Things seems fine and now it’s time to move forward again.
goodnight351,The Miami trip with friends was amazing!!
goodnight351,I had so much fun.
goodnight351,Just had little hard time today to get back to real life  It’s so cold in Chicago!!
goodnight351,I think I’m gonna sleep now..

goodnight303,Maybe tmw... or not...
goodnight303,Peaceful Sunday!
goodnight303,probably will go see the walking dead with friends at night.
goodnight303,That’s pretty much it!
goodnight303,Damn I think this depressing weather makes me wanna smoke lol
goodnight303,
goodnight566,
goodnight566,Feel like I’m missing something or empty.
goodnight566,Weird feeling I don’t really like it just making me nervous little.
goodnight566,Working, gym on lunch break (swam for today caused by hot weather), practicing speaking, laundry, BBQ chicken.
goodnight566,Yeah that’s pretty much it ohh and still tired little bit lol.
goodnight566,Read script almost 100 times now.
goodnight566,Still not good enough but definetly getting better.
goodnight566,Hope this thing works out well.
goodnight566,I’m not afraid to success or fail  
goodnight566,Sharing the story board for the video.
goodnight566,
goodnight638,
goodnight638,I thought I forgot about it.
goodnight638,I believed that I moved on.
goodnight638,However, it started to appear again.
goodnight638,not sure it’s just happening right now or will stay tmw and more.
goodnight638,However, right now I’m thinking about the things I wanted to get before like about an year ago  maybe I never forget about this until I actually get this and I don’t think I completely gave up on it.
goodnight638,I am taking detour right now but I will get there eventually.
goodnight638,right now I just must be aware of that all the time and keep try things instead of being lazy lol.
goodnight638,
goodnight613,
goodnight613,got new design today that I have been working on for about a month.
goodnight613,still needs improvements but works ok for now.

goodnight310,Tuesday but it feels like Thursday.
goodnight310,I haven’t really done anything this week Monday and today.
goodnight310,Just work and home.
goodnight310,I did nothing yesterday after work.
goodnight310,Just rolling around on my bed for little bit, later dinner and TV then had a trouble going sleep... Fortunately, I didn’t really feel tired at all today at work cause I was fully focused on the project all day.
goodnight310,I decided to build a plug-in for myself for this site since the one I paid is not really working out.
goodnight310,I don’t know if I’m gonna be able to get it done or not but I will try.
goodnight310,It makes more sense more me to have control for the main functionally of the site.
goodnight310,I can also make it more flexible that way since I want to make this more user friendly.
goodnight310,11:22 PM now in Chicago.
goodnight310,The weather is getting chilly everyday.
goodnight310,Winter is really coming.
goodnight310,Hopefully, this winter will be different.
goodnight310,Just expecting something new I guess 
goodnight310,
goodnight623,
goodnight623,got my third cold in this year.
goodnight623,I don’t know why I keep getting cold.
goodnight623,It usually comes once or twice in years but some reason I got third one already this year lol.
goodnight623,I’m feeling better today tho hopefully I get this over by tmw so I don’t have to suffer at work.
goodnight623,the weather is so nice today but I’m just staying home n being lazy all day.
goodnight623,
goodnight353,
goodnight353,And this time, the screen went off... I believe the phone is working but I can’t see or use anything on the phone cause the screen went dark  It’s been about 3 to 4 months when I fixed my screen.
goodnight353,I don’t think I’m going to spend couple hundred dollars again to fix my phone.
goodnight353,It’s seems to be better off with new phone since I wanted to move back to iPhone.
goodnight353,I just need some time to think about it before I make purchase.
goodnight353,I have been spending lots of money lately and have some things coming that I need to spend money even more.
goodnight353,So I just need to plan this out.
goodnight353,Well it sucks 
goodnight353,
goodnight433,
goodnight433,Had a lot of thoughts at work and don’t really know that was necessary or not.
goodnight433,Nothing special just things that I always think about.
goodnight433,The traffic on the way back home was awesome only took 35 mins to get home.
goodnight433,Hope it’s like this everyday.
goodnight433,Didn’t do much at home just took a shower n watching a movie.
goodnight433,Trying to go to sleep early since I had trouble sleeping last night.
goodnight433,I have been too lazy lately.
goodnight433,It’s time to get back to track but still not sure where to go.
goodnight433,Well I will fine it soon!
goodnight433,Goodnight!
goodnight433,
goodnight662,
goodnight662,Church in the morning.
goodnight662,Went to the closest Presbyterian church from my place cause all my family go to Presbyterian church.
goodnight662,Took about 20 mins to walk there.
goodnight662,It was little bit cold but the weather was nice enough to walk.
goodnight662,The church was actually really good.
goodnight662,Decent size, kind paster, n no one bother me to be a member.
goodnight662,I guess I will go there every Sunday now on.
goodnight662,Met up with a friend later n shopping.
goodnight662,I bought an awesome plant at Ikea n a futon at walmart.
goodnight662,Very satisfied for both of them.
goodnight662,Dinner at china town for johns bday n short meeting about jioh7.
goodnight662,It’s coming soon 
goodnight662,
goodnight493,
goodnight493,Didn’t have good day at work.
goodnight493,Well nothing happended, I just felt like I didn’t get enough opportunities to be creative n do something that really metters to the company.
goodnight493,I am ready n can do whatever it needs to get done but I don’t even get a chance to show what I can do.
goodnight493,Every time I try it just disappeared in the middle of the chain.
goodnight493,I really want to do things that matters n I will.
goodnight493,Yes I often think like this when I have no projects going on.
goodnight493,I guess I just have to be busy all the time.
goodnight493,
goodnight449,
goodnight449,I spent the laziest Sunday in like 2 months.
goodnight449,I have been lazy from last night when I decided not to go to the party at my friend place.
goodnight449,Since then, I just stayed at my apartment and did not really do anything but sleeping and eating lol.
goodnight449,Despite I went to bed earlier than usual last night, I woke up really late today and even skipped the church.
goodnight449,Some reason I just did not wanna do anything but being lazy.
goodnight449,So I did that all day long.
goodnight449,Woke up late, took a nap and spent most of the day on my bed and couch.
goodnight449,Now it’s 11:21 and trying to be little bit productive by writing a journal for a day.
goodnight449,Although I have been lazy all day with no motivation, I felt like 90% recharged and I wanna feel like 100% recharged when I wake up tomorrow morning.
goodnight449,Hope you had great weekend!
goodnight449,goodnight!
goodnight449,
goodnight616,
goodnight616,I don’t really have nothing special to write today.
goodnight616,did exact same things that I do pretty much everyday.
goodnight616,the weather was amazing tho.
goodnight616,the building that I work at wasn’t ready for the AC today so I was sweating little bit at work it was kind of annoying.
goodnight616,did work out on a lunch break and ran after work for an hour.
goodnight616,now I am at my place sitting at the computer trying to think something to write on my journal 
goodnight616,
goodnight397,
goodnight397,Such a beatutiful day on mother’s day!
goodnight397,I’m very happy about the weather today.
goodnight397,It just makes me feel so good and I believe it does same to others as well.
goodnight397,I could tell by people I taked today while I walked back to home from church.
goodnight397,Took some picture at my apartment cause it looks beautiful.
goodnight397,I think I got some thing to organizr before I get out for meeting at Belmont harbor.
goodnight397,Hope you all have a great mother’s day!
goodnight397,
goodnight474,
goodnight474,So these are the things I ate tonight for dinner.
goodnight474,I ate so much my belly is about to explode.
goodnight474,Although I know that I’m full, my brain keeps telling me to eat more and I’m having hard time to fight against it.
goodnight474,It’s happening lately that I constantly want more food.
goodnight474,that explains that why I was in the buffet restaurant last night lol
goodnight474,
goodnight291,
goodnight291,My journal for Wednesday!
goodnight291,I had a very typical day today.
goodnight291,Work and work out then drive right back to home.
goodnight291,I did pretty much everything that I was thinking about to do when I get home.
goodnight291,However, I couldn’t finish couple things.
goodnight291,Updating my portfolio which I started but couldn’t really get into it cause I noticed it will take longer than I thought.
goodnight291,It seems to be needing at least couple of days to get done.
goodnight291,So I’m taking it slowly lol.
goodnight291,Also need to check out some new technologies that I haven’t got a chance to use it yet.
goodnight291,That will be interesting.
goodnight291,It’s 11:37 PM and I already feel so sleepy.
goodnight291,Already on my bed and ready to sleep!
goodnight291,Thursday tmw then Friday!
goodnight291,Can’t wait for the weekend!
goodnight291,Goodnight all!
goodnight291,I’m sharing a pic of me after long time of not 😉 well do I look sick or sad on the pic?
goodnight291,One of my friends asked me if I were okay after sharing this pic on fb...
goodnight291,
goodnight369,
goodnight369,First time when I moved here to Chicago from Korea in 2006, I met some friends who also came here to learn English.
goodnight369,We became good friends and spent about 2 years in Chicago hanging out pretty much every weekends together.
goodnight369,It’s been over 8 years now and most of them already left here went back to Korea for the good reason or they just had to.
goodnight369,Today, I had to say goodbye to the very last one who’s been here with me till today.
goodnight369,I took a day off today to spend time with him and dropped him off at airport.
goodnight369,Feels little weird that makes me feel like I’m the only one left here.
goodnight369,Well I just wish them the best luck in Korea and one day we maybe get together again and talk about everything.
goodnight369,I’m glad tho that everyone is moving forward for their life and career.
goodnight369,And many other good friends here in Chicago around me who probably won’t move to any other country 
goodnight369,So I’m starting week by tomorrow and hope it won’t get cold as today lol
goodnight369,Goodnight!
goodnight369,
goodnight649,
goodnight649,typical.things I wanted to do, plans for the future, promises I made for myself all starting to scatter away.
goodnight649,I don’t expect things to happen over night.
goodnight649,However, I want to see little bit of improvement on it and I don’t think I see it or I just don’t notice it for now.
goodnight649,Regardless of all that, I just gotta do what I have to do.
goodnight649,Yeah, I just have so many thoughts on my head lol
goodnight649,
goodnight514,
goodnight514,got up at 2:30 AM could not go back to sleep since then.
goodnight514,just been watching couple video clips from youtube and going through GoodNightJournal.
goodnight514,I will probably have tough time at work today by not having enough sleep but I can’t go back to sleep just craving for steak.
goodnight514,I’m gonna go to grocery store at 6 and buy 5 steaks for breakfast.
goodnight514,
goodnight289,
goodnight289,Snowing day in Chicago!
goodnight289,Feel like I was pretty busy this weekend.
goodnight289,However, there were not many productive things except for having great time with friends lol.
goodnight289,Today I started a day with church and brunch after.
goodnight289,Then meet up with Anton and Natialia at Dollops to work on our first iOS app Complimenter.
goodnight289,It was just amazing how fast Anton built the app and we ended up with a working app after 2 hours maybe less.
goodnight289,Well it obviously needs more improvement but good enough to see how it works and get feedback from others.
goodnight289,I’m actually getting very excited for this.
goodnight289,Stayed there till 5:45 PM then headed to Miao for the walking dead show and chineses new year dumpling party.
goodnight289,Ate so much dumpling and beer also watched the walking dead.
goodnight289,Back home now and about to go to sleep.
goodnight289,11:30 PM now I know I’m ready for sleep but not sure if I’m ready for Monday yet lol.
goodnight289,Goodnight everyone!
goodnight289,
goodnight306,
goodnight306,Things are pretty much the same.
goodnight306,Same work, apartment and skating.
goodnight306,Getting little tired of same repeated daily life but have not really get any good news to break that circle and it costs too much to take a risk at the moment.
goodnight306,However, I know that I want some changes in my life.
goodnight306,Been spending my free time on new update on GoodnightJournal.com and New WordPress theme I designed for WP repository.
goodnight306,It bothers me little that plugin I purchased has some issues that effect features critically and it really delays everything I have planned.
goodnight306,I really want to have this update to offer better user experience on writing and managing journals but can’t just do that without fixing those issues on the plugin.
goodnight306,I’m still waiting for them to fix.
goodnight306,Also spending lots of time on skating and feel like I got way better on skate skills in past couple day.
goodnight306,Last Sunday session at Belmont harbor with Anton and Jose helped a lot for me to get to next level.
goodnight306,I love the jump and Mabrouk videos from last Sunday.
goodnight306,Can’t stop watching it 
goodnight306,Well that’s about it.
goodnight306,I just have to get things done!

goodnight513,I spent 99% of free time on this on last three days and it will be up in a day  Then I will improve more and more gradually.
goodnight513,Anyways, hope u all having great Saturday night.
goodnight513,
goodnight483,
goodnight483,I felt like starting a new week today in the morning when I get work then I realized it’s Thursday.
goodnight483,Damn one more day and it’s weekend again.
goodnight483,I love it!
goodnight483,I have a day off on next monday n morning on Thursday which means I only have to work 2 and a half days.
goodnight483,I just have to find way to spend all these time productively cause I have been wasting a lot of time for watching stupid soap operas lol.
goodnight483,That just made me think about the past.
goodnight483,
goodnight375,
goodnight375,Maybe I have been pursuing for something way too big.
goodnight375,Skipping all the steps in the middle and just want to jump right on it.
goodnight375,I have seen this article today that makes me think in a different way.
goodnight375,Maybe I should start with small things and try to get things one by one instead of taking a short cut that might not even exist.
goodnight375,Now I kind of see where all these frustration and disappointment come from.
goodnight375,So here I am trying to see what’s my next small step’s gonna be...
goodnight375,
goodnight367,
goodnight367,@anniecat Thank you so much for the notice on this issue.
goodnight367,There was an issue with commenting on the site and it has been fixed now.

goodnight634,
goodnight634,She called me today and we talked about 30mins to talk about everything as usual.
goodnight634,I found myself that I actually enjoy a lot to talk with my mom as I get older.
goodnight634,Asked her about North Korea since the media talks about North Korea a lot lately, it bothers me all the time cause my whole family is in South Korea.
goodnight634,However, she said everything is fine over there and people in South Korea don’t really worry about it at all which made me feel relived.
goodnight634,I kind of want my whole family to move here and live with me though, cause I miss them and North Korea still seems very unstable to me.
goodnight634,Lately, the marriage became hot issue for my mom.
goodnight634,every time I talked her over the phone, she never forgot to ask me about girl friend and when I said no, she starts to mentioning about arrangement marriage for the girls that she knows in Korea.
goodnight634,lol I feel little bit of pressure but I really don’t want to rush things up for this issue.
goodnight634,I still believe that I will meet someone someday who makes me want to get married.
goodnight634,well no more thinking about marriage that’s too much for me right now.
goodnight634,I will just go to sleep for tmw since I have to be at work by 9am, I have to wake up an hour early.
goodnight634,
goodnight438,
goodnight438,Sunday night diary, probably the best time to write a diary cause I usually spend some time on Sunday night to look back past week and planing the next week.
goodnight438,So looking back last week, I was just struggling on my new project all week.
goodnight438,nothing was really going on beside that cause I spend all my free time on that.
goodnight438,For next week, I want to launch the site.
goodnight438,I gave up the function I want and decided to change the direction little bit.
goodnight438,However if it goes well, I will get definitely that function in the site.
goodnight438,Well that’s that, I did a lot today.
goodnight438,church in the morning, laundry, cleaning up my apartment, went to shopping with my cousin and had dinner with more cousins.
goodnight438,I treated them today cause I got raised last week.
goodnight438,that my boss promised last year.
goodnight438,back home around 9PM, sitting at my computer trying to setup parkMartini again.
goodnight438,That’s all I did today.
goodnight438,How was yours?
goodnight438,how do u usually spend Sunday night?
goodnight438,?
goodnight438,
goodnight705,
goodnight705,Kind of expected little bit last night that I felt like I’m gonna get a cold and when I woke up today, I definitely felt that I’m getting sick.
goodnight705,cough and horrible runny nose.
goodnight705,especially the runny nose drives me crazy.
goodnight705,had over 1 liter of tea and hoping to get better soon.
goodnight705,I really wish to get better when I wake up tomorrow.
goodnight705,I don’t wanna get sick cause I don’t really have anyone to take care of me at this moment.
goodnight705,
goodnight308,
goodnight308,I have been thinking about new design on GoodnightJournal for about a month now.
goodnight308,Maybe over a month.
goodnight308,It took me almost 2 months to develop a plugin that I can use on main feature on GoodnightJournal and it is finally good enough to actually use it on site.
goodnight308,Yes, it is not perfect but just good enough to take a first step.
goodnight308,I will of course spend more time to make it better and this improvement will never end!
goodnight308,Decided to go with one of my theme Simtiful for the main layout and will add more modifications on features on the site.
goodnight308,The biggest mistake I have which I’m very well aware of is I did not really make actual design of the new site.
goodnight308,I have been thinking about this for long enough time I think I can just work on things our of my head.
goodnight308,There will me lots of tweaking but this will work out well.
goodnight308,Although I have the new design in my head, I still need to list out things I need to do to get the new design and some more details I need to add.
goodnight308,I would say I got about 10% done now maybe less but just can’t wait to show it to everybody.
goodnight308,Hope I can just focus on this projects all day for about 2 weeks!
goodnight308,
goodnight591,
goodnight591,Check out Angela’s article about writing a diary!
goodnight591,Self expression.
goodnight591,One of my favourite reasons for writing a diary is the ability to express what I’m feeling and thinking and by writing it down I’m channelling that energy into something just for me!
goodnight591,Actually my diary is filled with bus tickets, sketches, poems or articles I’ve read, quotes and interesting pieces of conversations.
goodnight591,I mix these with colours, and designs, and of course the way I write.
goodnight591,For example, I may write in Spanish or English, and my handwriting always changes.
goodnight591,I turn the pages and write in different directions or in capitals.
goodnight591,I like to explore different ways and write in the way it feels good for me at that time.
goodnight591,Nowadays I only buy diaries with blank pages so I have the freedom to create whatever I want on that page.
goodnight591,Express yourself through your diary.
goodnight591,Time for you.
goodnight591,Giving yourself time to write in your diary is literally setting aside time just for you, be it every week, every day or whatever.
goodnight591,Quality alone time.
goodnight591,I love to be on my own, writing down my thoughts and be able to come away from whatever environment I find myself in.
goodnight591,If your travelling or you live with other people, your dairy writing time can be a real treasured time of the day.
goodnight591,Wicked.
goodnight591,Writing is Therapeutic.
goodnight591,Writing out your ideas / inspirations / troubles and all your daily stuff is therapy.
goodnight591,An awesome one.
goodnight591,It gives you a freedom to express yourself and allows the words to flow out.
goodnight591,You can think things over and reflect.
goodnight591,It for sure contributes to a sense of well-being, sometimes I begin writing in a terrible mood and by the time I’ve finished I’m feeling on top of the world.
goodnight591,Write down your versions of events!
goodnight591,Re-reading and memories...
goodnight591,I cannot tell you how much I love, love, love re-reading my diary.
goodnight591,When I turn up in a new place or start a new part of my life, I like to write what I want to achieve or my first impressions and re-reading these is so much fun.
goodnight591,It’s also a really cool reference to look back at what you were doing at that time and you can see how much you’ve evolved!
goodnight591,Memories you forgot you had appear in personal detailed form... Also you can look back in pure embarrassment of the things you’ve done, which makes for great entertainment.
goodnight591,One reason why my diary is a private one.
goodnight591,Goal Setting.
goodnight591,Writing down dreams and ambitions is a beginning to step to achieving them.
goodnight591,Sometimes we have goals and forget all about them, only to return later and find we’ve completed them.
goodnight591,A while back I found myself reading a dairy of 2009.
goodnight591,I’d written one of the things I’d love to try in the world was tango dancing.
goodnight591,Completely unaware it was a thought that had occurred to me beforehand, I turned up in Argentina three years later and dedicated some time for learning to dance tango.
goodnight591,This has happened to me a lot, from riding horses to travelling certain countries... It’s also great to re-read for a reference, to write this blog I need to go back through all my dairies to trigger the memories I forgot I had..
goodnight591,A present just for you.
goodnight591,Your dairy is just for you.
goodnight591,It’s not something you have to share and it’s simply having an activity and dedication that is 100% yours..
goodnight591,Whether your writing about something you’ve seen on TV that’s inspired you, or day-to-day stuff.
goodnight591,It’s yours 100% your own creation of your life.
goodnight591,Get to know yourself better.
goodnight591,You get to spend time writing about what you have done, how you’ve reacted, what inspires you, what are you passionate about, the more you write, the more you see patterns and have more quality ‘you time’.
goodnight591,Get to know yourself more...
goodnight591,Creativity.
goodnight591,As mentioned above you can express yourself 100% and you can get really creative with your content.
goodnight591,I sometimes write in the 3rd person form, or I’ve even tried writing in Shakespearean language.
goodnight591,You can create poems if you feel inspired, simply, there are no rules!
goodnight591,Improving on those writing skills.
goodnight591,Just with any skill, the more you do it, the better you get.
goodnight591,So writing either daily or weekly helps you maintain and improve your writing skills!
goodnight591,And that’s just a bonus!
goodnight591,A little something for your grandchildren to read.
goodnight591,I would have loved to have read my grandparents dairy.
goodnight591,What life was like for them, in this ever-changing world and just the normal stuff they did day to day.
goodnight591,I’m sure grand-kids would love to read about ‘life before the mobile phone.’ It already seems like a lifetime ago...

goodnight708,I was confident, I thought I could get whatever I want.
goodnight708,However, it didn’t take that long too realize that life isn’t always go as u planned or expected.
goodnight708,Lack of preparation might caused all these situations to me but beside that I didn’t have any contingency plans n now I’m just collapsing.
goodnight708,Well, now I learn that things don’t always go as u planned or expected n it’s always good to have contingency plans.
goodnight708,However, i don’t regret for what I did.
goodnight708,At least i got to try what I wanted to do.
goodnight708,Now, it’s just time for me to move on.
goodnight708,
goodnight657,

goodnight313,I was kind of hoping maybe she is the one for me but it does not seem like it anymore.
goodnight313,It is funny that I write a journal with this issue that I usually don’t.

goodnight304,I have been working on a new project for GoodnightJournal.com!
goodnight304,As it grows everyday, I noticed that it is crucial to have entire control of the site for main features.
goodnight304,Although my programming skill is not there yet, I decided to make a plugin that will allow people to write articles from front-end on WordPress.
goodnight304,I actually made lot of progress last week and hoping to get something this week.
goodnight304,All I have to do at this point is to add editing feature and test it to see it work properly.

goodnight340,I just submitted GoodnightJournal iOS app to Apple’s App Store and had to pay $100 per year to do that(too expensive I think compare to Google Play Store).
goodnight340,I’m not sure how long it will take that to be approved and be available in App Store.
goodnight340,However, I feel very accomplished now.
goodnight340,Spent all night working on the app and spent pretty much all week to figure out how to make it work.
goodnight340,Well had to go through bunch of tutorial videos to make it happen.
goodnight340,I wanna give you a hand up that the first version is not gonna be perfect but I will try to improve it continuously.
goodnight340,So more people can enjoy writing journals.
goodnight340,Feel pretty exhausted now.
goodnight340,Still feel little sick and the cold medicine I took 30 mins ago finally kicks in.
goodnight340,I’m going sleep now... Goodnight everyone!
goodnight340,
goodnight352,
goodnight352,GoodnightJournal’s iOS App is now on Apple’s App Store for free!
goodnight352,It took a while to publish this app.
goodnight352,I know I should’ve done it long time ago lol.
goodnight352,Spent my last year’s holiday season to develop this app and I feel very happy to see it on the App Store.
goodnight352,Hope this helps more people to write journals.
goodnight352,Here is a link to download the app.
goodnight352,Just in case you can’t find it on App Store

goodnight656,It’s so complicated and involves so many docs and people.
goodnight656,I’m getting kind of irritated for following up all that.
goodnight656,However, they are no shortcuts, I just have to do it.
goodnight656,My refrigerator has been broken 2 days so today when I got home, I ate pretty much everything I had in my fridge.
goodnight656,Now I’m having really hard time to digest all that lol I will probably walk around my small living room for a while before I go to sleep.
goodnight656,Good night everyone n don’t forget to write a journal 
goodnight656,
goodnight460,
goodnight460,I don’t really have anything to write today except for that I got little depressed by something that I was expecting to see but did not happen.
goodnight460,I have been trying get something for months but I’m not getting anything back from it.
goodnight460,I kind of got used to it but sometimes I just get frustrated.
goodnight460,I guess today is the one of those days.
goodnight460,Even though I don’t get anything back or it gets me frustrated, I won’t give up cause I can’t live without goals or hope 
goodnight460,hopefully, things happen in year of 2014.
goodnight460,Goodnight!
goodnight460,
goodnight297,
goodnight297,This won’t be the last game for Cubs in 2015!
goodnight297,They are playing now at Wrigley field and now I’m watching Bulls game with a glass of gin & tonic cause I don’t have subscription for the Cubs game.
goodnight297,Plus, too lazy to go to the bar like 3 mins away 😉 However, if they win today and get to the world series, I will gracefully walk to the Wrigleyville to watch the game and enjoy the crowd!

goodnight515,As we get more traffics and members on the site, the amount of spam posts has increase significantly.
goodnight515,On Oct/30/2013 I decided to set up anti-spam system on the site that suppose to block spammer to post inappropriate content that irritates other users on the site.
goodnight515,However, the system turned out to be blocking some real members to login to the site.
goodnight515,I apologize to all the members who had experience trouble logging in to the site.
goodnight515,As today, I removed anti-spam system completely on the site and you won’t have trouble to login to the site.

goodnight330,
goodnight330,It was a very humid day in Chicago.
goodnight330,I had a very typical Sunday.
goodnight330,Church, laundry, journals and watching the game of throne with friends.
goodnight330,Also had huge lunch with John at sushi para.
goodnight330,It is 12:16 AM now and I am ready to sleep.
goodnight330,Just spend about an hour to going through new opportunities and try to see what I can get.
goodnight330,Now I’m recharged and ready to run again.
goodnight330,Let’s go till I get it!
goodnight330,Goodnight everyone 
goodnight330,
goodnight539,
goodnight539,I had a very long day today that I didn’t expected.
goodnight539,We had some sort of emergency at work that has to be taking care of in today.
goodnight539,So we stayed n worked till mid night from 10 am well some people worked from 9.
goodnight539,So tired now fully ready to fell asleep.
goodnight539,Good night.
goodnight539,
goodnight699,
goodnight699,Lately, I have a problem with sleeping.
goodnight699,couldn’t go to sleep till like 7 in the morning or something for whole week.
goodnight699,For a week, I fell a sleep around that time and wake up around 1pm but today I had to wake up by 10am to go to church.
goodnight699,I finally fell a sleep about 8 in the morning woke up around 10:50am by text message from olga lol.
goodnight699,couldn’t even take a shower just got my clothes on and went to church and stayed there till 4pm.
goodnight699,for the entire time, I was like half unconscious but I wanted to stay since it’s my last time to go that church and meet those people.
goodnight699,got back home around 4:30 took a shower and i’m ready to go to sleep now  it’s 5:40pm here.
goodnight699,N some reason I been up till now at 12:46am n can’t go to sleep again lol omg this is a torture
goodnight699,
goodnight542,
goodnight542,So my tripod finally arrived and noticed it shipped from Indiana which would take no more than couple hours  to drive there from Chicago.
goodnight542,Some how it took almost a week but the good thing is that I finally have it and I can start my thing going.
goodnight542,I set up all the light sources I have for the video as it shown on the picture.
goodnight542,As I expected, it was not enough lights to get the quality I want.
goodnight542,Now I’m debating myself on either spending couple hundred dollars for photography kit or just find way to work around it.
goodnight542,The biggest problem I have now is the shadow come from poor lighting set up.
goodnight542,I have noticed before when I worked on 3D stuffs that lighting set up is very important and difficult and now I get the same feeling again.
goodnight542,I will do some more research to see if I can save couple hundred dollars for things that I probably going to use once.
goodnight542,Anyways, I feel relieved for finally getting started again on my project.
goodnight542,
goodnight408,
goodnight408,Don’t really have much to write.
goodnight408,This is because I do pretty much same thing everyday.
goodnight408,Work all day, some work out, and more computer stuffs at home.
goodnight408,I just try to write down things I did today to keep in track and try to come up with better plan for tomorrow.
goodnight408,The weather was beautiful today, over 80 degrees on day time but it’s got rained at night.
goodnight408,Today, I went to pick up the bike from my friend place.
goodnight408,I drove to my friend place and we biked to my place for about 40 mins then we took a bus back to get my car back after having huge dinner at pizza place.
goodnight408,Today, I realized that I haven’t ridden a bike for over 8 years and forgotten about how fun it is.
goodnight408,Now that I got a bike, I will probably go on bike at least once a week.
goodnight408,I’m very excited about it.
goodnight408,This week, I don’t have a lot going on.
goodnight408,Just have on on going project that I have been waiting for the response for weeks.
goodnight408,It seems like a good time to organize my personal projects to see how am I going to spend my free time productively.
goodnight408,I and my friend talked about life and future little bit on the bus ride.
goodnight408,It didn’t really get into any answers as usual.
goodnight408,We just know we want to be successful but not really sure how even with a plan cause we know plans do not always work out as it intended.
goodnight408,Well it just got me think about things I have done and I want to achieve.
goodnight408,The bottom line is that I still have lots to accomplish and I won’t give up till I get all that!
goodnight408,Goodnight everyone.
goodnight408,
goodnight410,
goodnight410,Nothing special.
goodnight410,Just another Money that I work and did not really go anything after that.
goodnight410,Work out on lunch break as usual but couldn’t go out for skating or running cause of the weather.
goodnight410,The thing is that it didn’t actually rain in Chicago but it seemed like it will be rain soon for like all day.
goodnight410,Weather forecast said the same thing which made me stay at home.
goodnight410,I don’t like this sneaky weather.
goodnight410,Instead of going out, I spent time working on the UI project that pretty much takes up all my free time for weeks.
goodnight410,I need to finish this project soon and move on to other ones.
goodnight410,Just little bit of polishing up has left.
goodnight410,Had a late dinner myself and trying to see what to do for rest of the night.
goodnight410,It’s 10:50 PM watching Jimmy kimmel while I’m writing this.

goodnight396,I got up at 4:30 AM now I’m fully awake lol I went bed kind of early last night probably around 11:00 PM cause I have a doctor’s appointment in the morning at 9 AM.
goodnight396,However, I did not expect to be up this early.
goodnight396,Since that happened, I decided to enjoy the time.
goodnight396,So I watched the game of throne on the bed and now I’m writing an early journal.
goodnight396,It just passed 6 AM here so the grocery store right cross over the street should be open by now.
goodnight396,I just have to decide what I want to eat for breakfast.
goodnight396,Today, I have to get ready by 8:20 AM, stop by at doctor’s office for my ear, then work, and skating after work.
goodnight396,I don’t know how the weather will be tonight.
goodnight396,I think it will still go unless it rains but one thing we know it will be cold tonight.
goodnight396,I will drive to downtown after work and see how long it takes to get there hopefully not too long.

goodnight527,it does not look that bad right now but they are still talking about it in the news.
goodnight527,
goodnight587,
goodnight587,every time they release new update, I get nervous about GoodNightJournal that something might breaks up on my theme.
goodnight587,However, I want to keep it up to date so it performs faster and better security.
goodnight587,apparently, it works good with my theme on this site so far I tested.
goodnight587,anyways, enjoy journaling!
goodnight587,
goodnight439,
goodnight439,This is the bible phrases that my Dad tells me all the time and I like the most.
goodnight439,I don’t remember when but when I was young, I heard someone saying about the goals in life.
goodnight439,Set your goals as high as you can possible think.
goodnight439,Ever since that, I been having big goals that might not even possible to achieve.
goodnight439,However, one thing I know is that having those big goals get me going and I never give up till I get those.
goodnight439,Every time I read this phrase, makes me think of the goals in my life.
goodnight439,And trying to believe that I’m constantly asking, searching and knock everyday.
goodnight439,
goodnight608,
goodnight608,updated write a journal page to make it simple and easy.
goodnight608,please let me know what u think of new style on write a journal page.
goodnight608,this will be my focus till I get something that works for most people on here.
goodnight608,I think I still need better design on this page.
goodnight608,So Chicago cops found my car in West side of Chicago about 20 mins from my place.
goodnight608,when I got there I got little bit shocked cause everything were gone except for the body itself.
goodnight608,no choice just had to junk it.

goodnight554,work, gym on lunch break, and running by the lake after work.
goodnight554,Weather definitely got cool down which gave me better condition to run for an hour.
goodnight554,I noticed today that footer social media section that I fixed last night resulted a weird page load.
goodnight554,Assuming that was causing by facebook like button.
goodnight554,So I fixed back to what it was and removed send button since it does not seem to be necessary to have.

goodnight285,Weather’s got little warmer but still below 32.

goodnight285,So glad to have them as friends along with other awesome people!
goodnight285,So things I gotta do tonight is, catching up with my paper journals, get rough layout for the skating event (Suggestions from Gerard) and start working on t-shirt design.
goodnight285,Skating event seems to be going pretty good so far but I know there will be a lot more we have to take care as it goes on.
goodnight285,So trying to anticipate as much as we can now!
goodnight285,I guess not much going on other than that.
goodnight285,Also searching for ways to do marketing for this site.
goodnight285,Sent out couple emails to writers on big sites today.

goodnight652,
goodnight412,
goodnight412,Just wanted to say that cause I’m very happy for getting my internet back.

goodnight529,
goodnight437,
goodnight437,So my sister was asking me about what laptop to buy last night.
goodnight437,so I decided to get her a mac book air.
goodnight437,I tried to purchase it on apple’s Korean website but I couldn’t make it cause of payment process on apple’s Korean site was pain in the ass to go through.
goodnight437,Ended up purchasing on us apple’s site and picked  it up in the apple store at Lincoln park Chicago.
goodnight437,Thing went well till that point.
goodnight437,I had a nice lunch at Ali’s Grill (the cover picture) and went to FedEx to ship the mac book.
goodnight437,I filled out all the form and wrap in up with nice box.
goodnight437,I felt really good for giving her a gift that she needs.
goodnight437,Then the guy at FedEx told me the cost of the shipping will be $269.30 lol I really did not expect that to be that expected but I had no choice except for just paying it and go with FedEx cause USPS and UPS apparently don’t even deal with shipping laptop oversea.
goodnight437,It sucks but just had to go with it.
goodnight437,at this point just hoping that she gets in on time.
goodnight437,Tried to look for the new apartment but did not find one better than the one I’m living now.
goodnight437,Still don’t now if I wanna renew the lease or move out to somewhere else.
goodnight437,Suppose to go to the party my friend’s place but couldn’t make it cause I fell asleep and wake up late lol still feel tired.
goodnight437,Just gonna take a rest for rest of the night.
goodnight437,
goodnight425,
goodnight425,Woke up hours ago but still on my bed with my laptop and being really lazy 😀 I know that I have to do laundry and go gym for swimming but I don’t feel like moving at all lol.
goodnight425,So I’m just spending time on my bed for couple hours and it feels really good.
goodnight425,Just surfing internet and texting with my friends.
goodnight425,So today, I have only have a meeting at night with dinner and rest of day is free.
goodnight425,I will probably clean my apartment after the gym and look for apartment to move in.
goodnight425,It’s kind of hard to find one that I like with the price range that I can afford.
goodnight425,Hopefully I will find one soon.
goodnight425,Have a good weekend everyone!
goodnight425,
goodnight545,
goodnight545,had very typical Monday today.

goodnight307,Hopefully next year will be the same or better 
goodnight307,It’s the day after Christmas and it’s been raining all day here in Chicago.
goodnight307,Could not go out skating because of that but went to gym for swimming instead.
goodnight307,It was lots of fun to swim for an hour after not doing it for a while.
goodnight307,Well, swimming is good but I still feel like I need to find some other activities to do for days like this.
goodnight307,
goodnight472,
goodnight472,Dear diary, I had very busy day at work.
goodnight472,I spent most of day working on new design on the site that has about 10,000 pages of content.
goodnight472,I actually have had a new design from 6 month ago but it never got implemented on the site.
goodnight472,Today, I did improve the design and coded that design into actually website.
goodnight472,Since the site has tons of content and has not been updated for years, I needed to be really careful to make sure everything works good with new design and code.
goodnight472,I think I got about 80% done today and hopefully we can push the site within this week or earlier next week.
goodnight472,Well the bottom line is I had fun to working on that site.
goodnight472,Now I got home 3 hours ago, ate my ass off, took a shower and sitting at my computer thinking about my new project.
goodnight472,Trying to think what to do first...
goodnight472,

goodnight398,I feel like I got really lazy lately for writing journals.
goodnight398,I had somethings to take care of like moving and stuffs.
goodnight398,However even after the moving, I didn’t really keep up with journals as before and I want to change that.
goodnight398,I know writing journal everyday here might be almost impossible but I will try hard to write as many as journals possible for myself.
goodnight398,We had a chilly day today.
goodnight398,I kind of feel like the weather is getting colder and colder.
goodnight398,Despite the  chilly temperature and strong wind, I decided to go out skate when I got home from work cause I know  it will make me feel good and it did.
goodnight398,Skated for about 2 hours and back home had dinner myself then shower.
goodnight398,After that, I have been sitting at my computer doing things I haven’t done so far.
goodnight398,Things finally settling down here at new apartment and my life is getting back to normal.
goodnight398,So I gotta keep move forward again!
goodnight398,

goodnight659,Some reason the time went by so fast at work.
goodnight659,Seems like things go really well today before my car broke down lol my battery died so I had to get someone to jump my car n had to change battery at pep boys.
goodnight659,Had dinner with my friend at buffalo joes after that.
goodnight659,Back home worked on site.
goodnight659,Added fancy editor on write a journal page but I’m not really sure that I want to keep this or not since it has some issues with load speed n couple other things.

goodnight637,this is how I started my weekend and I feel good about it cause I feel like I did something productive today after work  I am planning to have lots of nap tomorrow!!!!

goodnight637,
goodnight607,
goodnight607,No choice 
goodnight607,I have to get a new car.
goodnight607,fortunately my parents are willing to help me out with down payment but they don’t want me to spend tons of money on my car.
goodnight607,I was not even in to nice cars anyways but I was thinking about getting Prius.
goodnight607,However, since they want me to spend less money on the car, I’m more leaning towards to Prius C. All my friends are trying to convince me not to get Prius with very important reason that no girls gonna date a guy who drives Prius especial on my age.
goodnight607,that actually almost convinced me.
goodnight607,It was really hard fact to ignore.
goodnight607,However, I found myself an answer that those girls are not the one for me.
goodnight607,I like hybrid car cause it saves environment and I believe someday I will meet a girl who has same opinion with me.
goodnight607,picture from official Toyota website.
goodnight607,
goodnight360,
goodnight360,So I made this site almost 2 years ago when I was in California.
goodnight360,Probably the toughest time in my life.
goodnight360,Those of you who know me probably know what I meant by that  By that time, I just needed to do something and decided to make an website for anyone who wants to write personal journal online.
goodnight360,Since I had been writing journals for over 8 years, it made sense to me to make website for that.
goodnight360,I have been running this site for almost 2 years now and met Sprout from the very beginning of the time on this site.
goodnight360,The amazing lady form Oregon who also has a very cute dog Sprout  Today I received a Christmas card from her that I didn’t expect at all and I really needed to share this good feelings that I got from her.
goodnight360,It really means a lot to me.
goodnight360,I feel very loved and special.
goodnight360,I am very glad that I could meet amazing people in this site and build a good relationships with them.
goodnight360,Sprout always has been my biggest supporter on this site and I really appreciate all the support I got from her.
goodnight360,All those comforting comments on my journals and sharing all those stories and pictures with me and others on the site.
goodnight360,Thank you so much for the Christmas card and all your support!
goodnight360,I wish you a wonderful Christmas and a blessed New Year!
goodnight360,Charlotte, Scott and Sprout

goodnight371,Got off at 6 PM as usual then drove to John’s work to pick him up.

goodnight293,I haven’t really smoked in summer time and just got back to smoking again lately even since the weather got cold.
goodnight293,Last weekend, I hit the peak that I smoked a pack of cigarette on 3 days.
goodnight293,Although, it was holiday weekend, that was way too much and now I’m trying to cut it back.
goodnight293,I just had a dinner and am really craving for a cigarette now!
goodnight293,I might give up and just go to the grocery market across the street and get a pack.
goodnight293,However, I want to try as hard as I can to see how far I can make this go on.
goodnight293,It’s much easier in summer time that I can just go out for skating and I forget about cigarette lol.
goodnight293,Anyways, the first day of work in 2016 was just okay as last year.
goodnight293,Very calm and comfortable.
goodnight293,Work out on lunch break as usual and got off at 6.

goodnight372,Also do some stuffs on weekdays.
goodnight372,Nothing seems wrong.
goodnight372,Everything is just too fine and it gets me depressed.
goodnight372,Nothing serious but I just hate this feeling.
goodnight372,Whatever I try to do, I can’t get rid of this feeling.
goodnight372,It always comes right back in.
goodnight372,Maybe the cold weather makes me feel like it?
goodnight372,or am I being single for too long?
goodnight372,I don’t know.
goodnight372,I just don’t like this feeling.
goodnight372,
goodnight385,
goodnight385,It’s been a long time for me to write a journal here.
goodnight385,That means yeah I have been pretty lazy.
goodnight385,I have to admit.
goodnight385,Anyways, it was typical Tuesday.
goodnight385,Work till 6 PM work out with Peter on lunch break.
goodnight385,The traffic was okay after work so I got home about 20 mins earlier than usual.

goodnight385,Now I got back home and trying to wrap up the day.
goodnight385,Tomorrow, I have to work on freelance stuffs and it will take pretty much all my free time after work which is fine since I don’t have a lot going on lately.

goodnight344,March/18/2015 11PM in CST, I updated new design on GoodnightJournal.com.
goodnight344,I wanted to make it more simple and easy to write/read journals.
goodnight344,I choose one column layout and removed all unnecessary stuffs out of the way.
goodnight344,So people can focus on writing and reading journals better.
goodnight344,Hope it helps for the users who write journals here.
goodnight344,FYI, this is the beginning of the making this site better.
goodnight344,There will be more small updates to make things work smoothly.
goodnight344,Please feel free to leave any comments or feedback on the comment section.
goodnight344,I would love to hear your thoughts and I will listen!
goodnight344,
goodnight286,
goodnight286,Just talked my mom and grand mom in Korea.
goodnight286,My grand mom had a surgery couple days ago and she’s finally going back to home from the hospital.
goodnight286,She does not sounds very good when I talked her on the phone.
goodnight286,Though she is definitely recovering from the surgery.
goodnight286,Hope it won’t be to hard for her to get back to normal.
goodnight286,My mom also did a lot to take care of her.
goodnight286,Although I’m not there to see but I can tell.
goodnight286,Maybe it’s about time for me to go see them again.
goodnight286,Had a pretty decent day today.
goodnight286,Nothing special to write about.
goodnight286,I’m just so glad it’s Thursday night  Seems like this weekend will be busy.
goodnight286,Going snowboarding and catching up with friends!
goodnight286,will be fun.
goodnight286,9:07 PM here in Chicago.
goodnight286,Feel already sleepy and I think I need some extra time for sleeping.
goodnight286,Since I stayed up late playing around with backing up this site.
goodnight286,It’s good that I finally figured out what to do and saw it worked!
goodnight286,Things are gonna go smooth now on 😉
goodnight286,Goodnight everyone!
goodnight286, 
goodnight286,
goodnight536,
goodnight536,I got my first test render for the video and it looks good so far.
goodnight536,It still needs a fine tuning but I will do that after I got my real footage which I will get on Thursday so everything is right on track I guess.
goodnight536,I had very typical day today except for that I kind of wanted to go out after work which I did not even try to.
goodnight536,Probably gonna watch a movie before the sleep.
goodnight536,anyways, good night everyone!
goodnight536,
goodnight646,
goodnight646,feel like my life is getting boring as the time goes.
goodnight646,do pretty much same things everyday and nothing seems interesting.
goodnight646,loosing motivations and my personal goals become blurry.
goodnight646,Maybe I need a vacation  thinking about adding most recent public journals and pics from public journals on main page cause the main page looks too plane to me.
goodnight646,tried to make couple different designs but it didn’t look that good so I guess I will keep work on it till I get the design that serves better for users.
goodnight646,Just in case sprout22 read this, I didn’t forget about the theme I’m constantly researching and thinking to find the best solution to implement that in GoodNightJournal.com 
goodnight646,Anyways, we all get depressed or frustrated sometimes in our life as I am right now.
goodnight646,However, I believe that we all need that to get better and be more thankful when the good day comes  
goodnight646,For me, just writing things in my mind makes me feel so much better & relieved than just keep thinking about it.
goodnight646,
goodnight384,
goodnight384,It’s been kind of busy Sunday.
goodnight384,Church in the morning and picnic in the afternoon with skating group that I love  The weather was beautiful and there were bunch of new people showed up for the first time.
goodnight384,We had really good time at the lake till almost 6 PM.
goodnight384,Now I’m trying to wrap up the week.
goodnight384,just finished writing journals for week and doing laundry.
goodnight384,Feel like I have a lot going on.
goodnight384,I really need to sit down and organize stuffs.
goodnight384,I will have to write it down by priority and do things one by one.
goodnight384,I guess my new freelance work will be the first thing that I have to finish up this week which I’m already working on it.
goodnight384,then spend some time with my personal projects that I have neglecting for a while.
goodnight384,I feel really guilty for that.
goodnight384,Things are still really mess in my head right now and I will try to organize them after I put my laundry to the dryer lol
goodnight384,I was talking a picture above and my friend took a picture of me taking that picture.
goodnight384,that’s what’s going on with pictures 
goodnight384,
goodnight614,
goodnight614,Got an message from Dustinee today about the suggestions on this site.
goodnight614,that made me realize that I haven’t forgot about the functionally side of the site.
goodnight614,I spent most of time focusing on user experience and design side and still working on new theme lol.
goodnight614,Now that Dustinee reminded me that, I will add those things on my to do list and try to get all of those functions on the site.
goodnight614,She suggested adding friends button and be able to manage it,
goodnight614,direct messages to other users,
goodnight614,comment notification on the site not only with email,
goodnight614,and Like/Favorite button.
goodnight614,this will probably take some time for me to integrate all that.
goodnight614,However, I promise I will do my best to get that things done for people on GoodNighrJournal.com.
goodnight614,Since I finished watching 62 episodes of K-drama, I can finally dedicate most of my free time on this site  I want to say thank you to Dustinee for great suggestions and interest on this site.
goodnight614,it means a lot to me!

goodnight418,We had amazing day today in Chicago.
goodnight418,Almost 60 degrees and sunny.
goodnight418,So I decided to put on my skate and go out to lake after church.
goodnight418,First time this year felf so great to be skating around lake.
goodnight418,However, after a long break my body couldn’t keep up with my mind.
goodnight418,I had to take extra more breaks to get to the downtown took me about an hour to get there plun the wind blowing against me which made it way harder.
goodnight418,After hitting the downtown, I head back to home and in the middle of the road I saw my friend came out for skating too.
goodnight418,It was funny that I ran into them.
goodnight418,I tried to do more runs with them but had to give up cause I got cramp on both legs lol.
goodnight418,Took another hour to get back going really slow so I donlt get cramp cause it tend to happen consistently once I get it.
goodnight418,Anyways, it was good day.
goodnight418,Yeah summer is almost here!
goodnight418,Also I found a place that might work out for me just have to call them tomorrow to see it’s still available or not.

goodnight430,
goodnight430,I always have questions for myself that why am I always thinking too much, Why can’t I just be satisfied for what I have right now and want more and more.
goodnight430,I keep asking myself but still don’t know why.
goodnight430,It’s just me and I just gotta keep going for what I want.
goodnight430,For doing that, I tend to be over stressed out.
goodnight430,Sometimes, it’s frustrating when you don’t get what you try for.
goodnight430,Despite knowing that, I just have to keep going and I know I never give up.
goodnight430,It will probably like this for a long time.
goodnight430,What do you think?
goodnight430,is this good way to live your life?
goodnight430,
goodnight484,

goodnight603,From Wendy’s.I had to try it cause it looked so good on commercial n i love prezet bugers.
goodnight603,Surprisigliy It was so good does not taste like fast food at all.
goodnight603,Yeah it is very hard to believe that Wendy’s came out with real food 😀
goodnight603,Work was very boring today.
goodnight603,Came back to my normal schedule.
goodnight603,Walking around my neighborhood for a while.
goodnight603,Now I’m ready to go to sleep.
goodnight603,Will write my journal tmw.
goodnight603,
goodnight544,
goodnight544,Starting my day with deleting spams on the site like any other days.
goodnight544,the only difference is that I am still drunk.
goodnight544,spent almost hundred dollar for nothing last night but I had fun I guess.
goodnight544,
goodnight626,
goodnight626,I have been thinking about this quite a lot lately.
goodnight626,well I think about that all the time ever since I gave up my goal after graduation.
goodnight626,I guess my life has been kind of settled down in a boring way.
goodnight626,working full time make money for living go out on weekend so on so on... yeah I’m definitely missing something and I believe that is the goal that I need to pursue.
goodnight626,always saying and deciding to sit down and organize things, write down things I want in my future but I never really spent time to do all that.
goodnight626,these days I’m just spending time on this site beside going out spending money.
goodnight626,I want to get the goals like a year ago.
goodnight626,I want to be crazy for something.
goodnight626,I want to move forward.
goodnight626,this is not the place for me to settle down.
goodnight626,remember your journey is not even close to the end yet.
goodnight626,you still have long way to go and I am going to enjoy it.
goodnight626,
goodnight687,
goodnight687,I failed  couldn’t keep it up everyday.
goodnight687,It seems to me, it’s almost impossible.
goodnight687,However, I still write a journal whenever I have time n still agree with that writing something everyday is good.
goodnight687,Writing journal comes to me like leaving a traces to look back n gives me time to think about that, makes me come up with better plans for tmw.
goodnight687,I will finally have time to work on this site probably next week n I can’t wait!!
goodnight687,!
goodnight687,
goodnight588,
goodnight588,every time they release new update, I get nervous about GoodNightJournal that something might breaks up on my theme.
goodnight588,However, I want to keep it up to date so it performs faster and better security.
goodnight588,apparently, it works good with my theme on this site so far I tested.
goodnight588,anyways, enjoy journaling!
goodnight588,
goodnight361,

goodnight323,It’s been a very typical Monday.
goodnight323,Work and home that I do everyday.
goodnight323,Gym on my lunch break and skating after work.
goodnight323,I got home around 6:50 PM and got out to skate around 7:00 PM then I encountered with a lady at the entrees of my apartment building who I know I met before but did not remember who she was.
goodnight323,She ended up recognized me first and we started talking.
goodnight323,She turned out to be John’s boss who came here to see what’s going on with him.
goodnight323,I just told her he moved out last month and let her know if I can get in touch with him.
goodnight323,It got me worried about him and he’s still not responding on my call or text.
goodnight323,I will wait till tomorrow have to check with his family.
goodnight323,It just weird tho that she came over here.
goodnight323,Something seems suspicious either her or John.
goodnight323,Just hoping he will be find and stay out of trouble.
goodnight323,It was a very hot day in Chicago.
goodnight323,Probably the hottest day/night in this years.
goodnight323,AC is on to cool me down and I’m just going though the stuff online.
goodnight323,I have to wake up early tomorrow for another opportunity who probably will freak out for the status thing like the others.
goodnight323,Well I just have to try tho.
goodnight323,So I’m going sleep little early tonight.
goodnight323,Goodnight and sweet dreams!
goodnight323,
goodnight275,
goodnight275,here in Chicago.
goodnight275,The weather has been pretty depressing for past couple months.
goodnight275,Well if you know the winter in Chicago but today, we had an unexpected beautiful day and of course I had to get out with my skate.
goodnight275,Too bad I woke up too late today after waking up at 6 in the morning and got back to sleep till 12:30 PM.
goodnight275,However, I spent rest of the day outside enjoying the weather with my favorite people.
goodnight275,I skated almost 17 miles today and practiced many tricks that I want to master this year 
goodnight275,Hopefully one day, I will share a video showing one of the tricks I have been practicing.
goodnight275,We hang out at Grant park and the field museum till the sun goes down then had lots of food and some drinks at Anton and Natalia’s place.
goodnight275,Yes, it was a lot of fun and I had a great time!
goodnight275,I skated back to home around 9 PM.
goodnight275,I just can’t wait for the summer!!!
goodnight275,It seems like I need to spend rest of my weekend to get my things done.
goodnight275,I really need to update my portfolio updated and work on the App design that I have been working on with my friend.
goodnight275,It’s 11:34 PM in Chicago.
goodnight275,Doing my laundry and spending time on GoodnightJournal.com.
goodnight275,PrettyinBlack really got me today.
goodnight275,I just love and so grateful to see her journal today and it really hit me to get more involved with this site.
goodnight275,It’s true that I have been very lazy writing journals here and read journals from others.
goodnight275,In fact, I’m not a big fan of reading in general but I know I need to read more and I will do it here.
goodnight275,I remember the time when I talked a lot with others maybe two years ago and it was a great memory!
goodnight275,I definitely want that again.
goodnight275,Many thanks to PrettyinBlack!
goodnight275,Hope all of you are having a great weekend!
goodnight275,Summer is on the way 😉
goodnight275,Pic – Taken from Grant Park Chicago.
goodnight275,
goodnight349,
goodnight349,So I started again working on new design for GoodnightJournal today.
goodnight349,Well I have been thinking about it for months and actually took a first step couple weeks ago but I have been kind of busy lately and did not have time to work on it.
goodnight349,Today, I got some time to go back and restart where I stopped.
goodnight349,I actually got some progress today and it got me very excited.
goodnight349,It will have much simple interface which will make writing way easier.
goodnight349,Got my new font selected and got main layout done almost!
goodnight349,Just little worry about the new functions that I want to implement on new design.
goodnight349,Hopefully it won’t take that long.
goodnight349,It will still need some time for me to launch it but I just can’t wait to talk about it!
goodnight349,Can’t wait to show it to everyone!
goodnight349,I just gotta work my ass off 
goodnight349,
goodnight548,
goodnight548,Feel tired all day.
goodnight548,Back home from the work about 20 mins ago n trying to go to sleep now.
goodnight548,Expecting to be waking up at tmw morning with full of energy!
goodnight548,
goodnight455,
goodnight455,It’s been like a week that I’m like so close to the end but can’t figure it out the one thing that is critical to the site.
goodnight455,Still excited about the new project that I have been working on for weeks but at the same time I get frustrated pretty much everyday for that one thing I really need.
goodnight455,I wish I knew more programming so I can just write my own code.
goodnight455,Tonight, I tried couple different ways to solve the problem but nothing worked out.
goodnight455,more research needed and maybe I need complete new structure.
goodnight455,I don’t know right now; I’m just too burned out, can’t think clearly after sitting at computer for like 14 hours lol.
goodnight455,
goodnight683,
goodnight683,started working on another website today!
goodnight683,I actually bought a domain 2 months ago but could not have time to work on that so far.
goodnight683,Today, I spent all my day working on that site hoping to get it done by today.
goodnight683,it’s over midnight rignt now and I still have to fix so many things on that site.
goodnight683,lol much more work than I expected.
goodnight683,I guess, it needs at least a week to open beta service.
goodnight683,I couldn’t even watch the walking dead tonight cause of this  and now I need to go to sleep for work tmw.
goodnight683,well at least I did something productive over the weekend 
goodnight683,
goodnight278,
goodnight278,Working on SkateChicago.org for past couple days and I finally pushed it to live today.
goodnight278,It’s not quite ready yet but good enough to share it with friends who are working on this skating event in Chicago and improve it for the big announcement.
goodnight278,I did not have enough time to work this the way I usually do.
goodnight278,Just spent 3 days to make this from scratch except for the back-end lol of course.
goodnight278,Despite the time I spent, it came out pretty good at least in my perspective.
goodnight278,I like the logo!
goodnight278,I think it conveys the exciting/fun skating event and the city of Chicago.
goodnight278,Still gotta do lots of work to get this going but I’m very excited to work this together with my favorite people.
goodnight278,Can’t wait till June to actually see this happen!
goodnight278,More update about this will come here 
goodnight278, 
goodnight278,
goodnight592,
goodnight592,woke up at 3:30AM n can’t go back to sleep, decided to work on updating sites that I have procrastinated.

goodnight592,

goodnight390,to write a journal here.
goodnight390,the same thing that I have been saying that yeah I have been very lazy for this.
goodnight390,Although nothing really going on with my life, I kind of feel like busy and tired all the time.
goodnight390,Also feel like missing something really important in my life and don’t really know what it is?
goodnight390,Am I getting lonely for being myself for too long?
goodnight390,do I need a girl friend?
goodnight390,do I need a new job?
goodnight390,or a new fresh project to work on?

goodnight390,it’s just something that I’m not quite satisfied about my life...
goodnight390,It’s 6 AM on Tuesday.
goodnight390,I got up so early today by no reason.
goodnight390,cause I went sleep before midnight?
goodnight390,or my body wants to do something in the morning before I go to work?
goodnight390,Anyways, I’m fully awake now and probably not going to go back to sleep.
goodnight390,It’s got little cold here in Chicago which makes me think that summer is going away.
goodnight390,Time goes by fast and I’m not getting things that I want which makes me little nervous and uneasy.
goodnight390,
goodnight710,
goodnight710,Still trying to solve the problem with Facebook like button.
goodnight710,Did lots of searches but didn’t see any solutions.
goodnight710,Seems like I’m the one of the very few people who’s having the same problem which is bad luck for me cause there aren’t that many resources for that issue.
goodnight710,Well, I will keep looking tomorrow.

goodnight510,Well I don’t mine being busy at work; I actually prefer to be busy.

goodnight328,I just want to write down things I have done this week.
goodnight328,On Monday, I went to Lissie’s show in Lincoln Hall with Jad.
goodnight328,I did not even know who she was and not a big fan of folk music either.

goodnight328,We ended up having good time.
goodnight328,It was actually fun.

goodnight328,It has an amazing view of Chicago and I was with people I love!
goodnight328,We had a great time with food, drink and talk.
goodnight328,It’s so sad that she has to leave.

goodnight399,So I got almost everything unpacked now but still no internet.
goodnight399,I talked to the girl next door and she’s willing to share it with us but we haven’t got a password yet.
goodnight399,Maybe tmw we pay half of the price she pays and get access for it.
goodnight399,It drives me crazy that I don’t have access to internet with my computers.
goodnight399,Hopefully this issue gets solved tmw.
goodnight399,Beside moving to new apartment, nothing really going on.
goodnight399,Work, gym and home exactly the same days.

goodnight332,I started to learn JavaScript all over again today.
goodnight332,I have used it for years but I never really had a chance to study from beginning.
goodnight332,As I use more and more on real life projects, I noticed more that I need to understand basics of it.
goodnight332,Understanding the basics will help me build better products in the future.
goodnight332,This will take some time and effort.
goodnight332,I just need to stay focus and finish it as soon as possible.

goodnight311,Time really flies.
goodnight311,It also means my work visa will be expired in an year too and I’m still not sure what I want to do.
goodnight311,Well it’s more likely I haven’t got things I have been wanting to have.
goodnight311,Maybe I’m not good enough or I just have really really bad luck.
goodnight311,Well, I will keep try regardless of result and I won’t regret even if I ended up not getting it cause I tried as hard as I could.

goodnight295,Big thank you to Anton who pretty much walked me through setting up new server for twice and all the amazing people in WordPress community and Stack Overflow who helped me out with bunch of programing issues.
goodnight295,There are still lots of things to improve but I’m so glad I just took the first step for doing all that.
goodnight295,I was able to build my own plugin for the main feature of site which will allow me to design the site with more flexibility.
goodnight295,I’m very excited for the improvement that I will make and see how people will interact with it.
goodnight295,It was probably the one of the best Christmas I ever had in my life.
goodnight295,Hope you like the new design on GoodnightJournal.com.

goodnight421,For that matter, I actually took a first step yesterday by starting a new project.
goodnight421,This new project is very cool.
goodnight421,I’m building a WordPress framework that can help people who wants to develop their own custom theme.
goodnight421,I’m not sure how it’s gonna work out but I believe that my project will help a lot of people to make their own WordPress theme.
goodnight421,My framework is being reviewed by WordPress’s theme review team.
goodnight421,Hopefully, it’s get approved and be available for everyone on WordPress website.
goodnight421,So that’s what’s going on with my life these days.
goodnight421,Stop being lazy, do things for people and my future, keep expecting for things that excite me.

goodnight655,it was boring Saturday.
goodnight655,kind of expected to do something fun but just ended up at home working on my website all day.
goodnight655,Don’t really have anything to write.
goodnight655,hopefully, I woke up on time tmw for church that I couldn’t make last week.
goodnight655,still have many thoughts in my head, try to forget all about it by making myself busy....
goodnight655,everything will be fine.
goodnight655,My experience in Cali, made me realize that life is NOT always go as I expected or planned.
goodnight655,Although I am fully aware of that, I still think I need plans and a full of expectation for the future and most importantly actually do it whatever I have in my mind.
goodnight655,
goodnight348,
goodnight348,So my apartment lease is gonna be end in a month and I have to decided in a week whether if I want to renew or not.
goodnight348,I’m still not quite sure what I want to do with it.
goodnight348,I do have a decent apartment at good location with very good price and my landlord is willing to give me a discount if I renew the lease.
goodnight348,However, I’m not very satisfied with my current living situation.
goodnight348,Not thing wrong with it.
goodnight348,There are just little things that bother me little bit.
goodnight348,Things like me spending all the money for kitchen supplies and cleaning apartment myself when my roommate were out of town for work and he coming up with excuses for not doing anything  due to the vacancy he has for work.
goodnight348,It was okay first and time goes by this starting to bother me little lol.
goodnight348,I guess I just don’t want to have extra thing that I have to take care of...
goodnight348,Since my roommate is my cousin, I’m more than willing to help him out as much as I can.
goodnight348,I think I’m gonna see if he’s gonna be good for affording apartment by himself first and make plan accordingly.
goodnight348,Still have a week to think about so I’m good for now.
goodnight348,Today I got up around 7 AM to drop off my little cousin at airport.
goodnight348,Back home, doing laundry and had breakfast myself.
goodnight348,It’s only 9:41AM now.
goodnight348,I’m gonna take some rest till noon and go out for skating 
goodnight348,The weather is amazing here in Chicago today and I’m going to take advantage of it.
goodnight348,Hope you do the same too!
goodnight348, 
goodnight348,
goodnight347,
goodnight347,Had hard time sleeping last night.
goodnight347,Got up couple times cause my nose n throat got dried up while I was sleeping.
goodnight347,It’s been happening for couple days and today I finally feel sick not as much as last time when I couldn’t go to work but annoying enough for me to do my daily stuffs.
goodnight347,Tried to go to sleep around 9:30pm but couldn’t fell asleep so I’m writing journal now on my new iPhone.
goodnight347,Debated for a day if I wanna get new phone or not.
goodnight347,Ended up getting new iPhone 6 I actually wanted to get.
goodnight347,So my bills gonna be up but now I’m enjoying my new phone:) it’s been snowing all day and it will get colder this week.

goodnight347,Stay warm everyone!
goodnight347,
goodnight318,
goodnight318,You probably noticed already if u r reading this that public journal page is loading very slow.
goodnight318,This is because I’m working on this page.
goodnight318,There was a change in public journal page that it only shows one latest journal entry from each author in the site.
goodnight318,This will prevent seeing bunch of journal entries from one author.
goodnight318,I’m still working on this page to load faster and it is taking longer than I expected.
goodnight318,I’m trying to get this done within this weekend.
goodnight318,Please be patience till then.
goodnight318,Sorry for the inconvenience.
goodnight318,
goodnight376,
goodnight376,Feel so much better yesterday but still don’t feel okay.
goodnight376,Last time I got sick like this was like 6 years ago when I passed out all day for like almost a week.
goodnight376,Today, I was able to make it to work.
goodnight376,I almost call off but feel so irresponsible to do it two days in a row plus I felt good enough to walk around.
goodnight376,It’s lunch break and I skipped the gym.
goodnight376,Instead had a soup and writing a journal after long time of not lol
goodnight376,

goodnight325,My cover image is the funny guy from Silicon Vally and I have to take a pic of that T-shirt.
goodnight325,I’m not really writing something relevant to that t-shirt at all just wanted to have a cover image cause I haven’t have it for a while 😉
goodnight325,Feel little defeated lately after going through some failures for the better opportunities.
goodnight325,It just happens once in a while although I have been going through this for years.
goodnight325,Some recovery time is needed at this moment.
goodnight325,No matter what, I still believe things are going to get better and I will keep try till I get them.
goodnight325,I’m also not gonna be lazy for improving myself and my skill sets.
goodnight325,It’s just a thing I need to do till I die.
goodnight325,Got many thoughts on my head now and I’m just trying to writing down things as it pops up in my head.
goodnight325,It might sounds stupid when you read this but it definitely helps me organize my thoughts.
goodnight325,So....
goodnight325,What’s next now.
goodnight325,I still have to work on public journal page to help people finding journals from others.
goodnight325,This is actually way hard for me to solve and it’s taking a long time.
goodnight325,Hopefully I will find a solution soon.

goodnight675,It was busy day for me did bunch of things  until now.
goodnight675,Well, now that I don’t really have anything to do makes me think about stupid things like what’s the most important thing in my life, what am I pursuing for ... Etc etc.. Can’t even describe what I’m thinking its just so messy n complicated.
goodnight675,Maybe I should just keep myself really busy for a while or take another vacation to somewhere to clear my head.

goodnight424,I ate so much I’m still having a hard time digesting all that food I had.

goodnight391,so that’s that.
goodnight391,Still haven’t got back to Joe yet I guess I will call him tmw morning on my way to work and the new project that I briefly mentioned to Fred.
goodnight391,For this project, I really need some good developers in the team to move forward and I’m trying to see who I can get on board.
goodnight391,Well actually I need to plan out and organize stuff first which will take some time.
goodnight391,Because all I have right now is just a concept lol
goodnight391,Michelle asked me to have a dinner tonight but I decided not to go cause I need some time to get things organized tonight and I feel really lazy to go out lol.

goodnight391,
goodnight504,
goodnight504,Up at 9:30 gave a ride to john, work out in the gym.
goodnight504,Back home went on inline skating for over an hour.
goodnight504,It probably was not a good idea to do that in this weather and I fell down once.
goodnight504,Luckly it was not that bad.
goodnight504,Back home around 3 cleaned up my apartment while I was doin laundry.
goodnight504,After that, just seating on my couch watching TV all day.
goodnight504,This is way too peaceful for me which got me so bored...
goodnight504,
goodnight387,
goodnight387,Lately, I always feel like I got bunch of things to get done and did not really know what to do or where to start.
goodnight387,I kind of feel like that it’s programed in my brain that I’m busy that I got things to do.
goodnight387,Well yes I do and I do all the things that needs to be done but I don’t have to be push my self and stressed down about that.
goodnight387,I guess I need to learn the way to enjoy my life and do things that needs to be done.
goodnight387,It’s always been my problem that when one thing gets in my head, I can get rid of it till I solve that issue or remove the problem.
goodnight387,I need to give myself a room to breath and be calm.
goodnight387,Today, I spent most of my free time working on the freelance project that I have been thinking of all day.
goodnight387,It feels really good to get things done but just hated the time that I was worrying about it all day.
goodnight387,I always wanna move forward, make myself better and get things that I want.
goodnight387,For doing that, I think I push myself way too much in a very not productive way.
goodnight387,As I always say, I need to sit down and take a time to think back and organize stuffs.
goodnight387,It does not seem like a lot going on rest of the week.
goodnight387,Hopefully, I will have the time for that.
goodnight387,Just wrote my messy thoughts and yes it is messy...
goodnight387,
goodnight477,
goodnight477,I took a day off today for the dentist but it got messed up now.
goodnight477,My insurance company has this stupid waiting period thing that I can only get benefits after an year of sign up day which will be Sep/1/14.
goodnight477,So I have to go talk to HR tmw to find out what I can do.
goodnight477,Also had a car wash for thr first time since I got a new car.
goodnight477,After the car wash I realized that I need to take care of my car almost 6 momths of abandonment really messed up my car paint.
goodnight477,Stopped by downtown for quick shipping and will go ice skating in Lincoln park zoo(pic above) in a min.
goodnight477,So we got one more day left for 2013.
goodnight477,How should I spend the last day productively or memorably?

goodnight621,I just noticed that I been missing lots of days for writing journal.
goodnight621,only see 3 entries in May lol.
goodnight621,this is horrible.
goodnight621,I wanted to write every day journal in 2013 and apparently it’s impossible to do that now.
goodnight621,one of another typical day for me.
goodnight621,went to graphic designer meeting after work.
goodnight621,got some good information about freelancing since I want to get some freelance work, I guess it was good decision to go there.
goodnight621,been working on new theme ever since I got home from that meeting and now I’b about to go to sleep.

goodnight621,will work on style tmw.

goodnight475,So it’s been snowing crazy for 2 days and it finally stopped at around 9:30.
goodnight475,I got out to shovel the snow n noticed my neighbor shoveled snow toward to front of my car.
goodnight475,I couldn’t take a pic of before I shoveled snow around my car cause I did not bring my phone at first time but my car’s front was basically all buried in the snow that my neighbor dumped.
goodnight475,Thanks to my neighbor for giving me extra time to work out by shoveling snow.
goodnight475,Spent about 30 mins to get my car out of the snow so I can just drive away tmw morning for work.
goodnight475,I was thinking about dumping back all the snow plus more snow to my neighbor’s spot but I did not do that cause I don’t want to be an asshole.
goodnight475,However, looking at his spot that how clean he shoveled his spot gets me wanna be a selfish like him.
goodnight475,
goodnight427,
goodnight427,Yay it’s Friday night and I’m having a very peaceful time now myself at home.
goodnight427,Did things I haven’t done for a week.
goodnight427,Enjoying time that I don’t really have to do or have to go anywhere.
goodnight427,Well I got things to do but noting urgent and I can take time to take a break for a night.
goodnight427,Feels like its been a while that I have these kind of time myself.
goodnight427,I’m already on my bed now.
goodnight427,Don’t really want to do anything and I love it.
goodnight427,Have a great weekend everyone
goodnight427,
goodnight665,
goodnight665,Some reason even though I started write a journal online, I can’t just ignore my journals on notebook which I have been keeping for about 7 years.
goodnight665,So I’m writing journals on my notebook with a pen and here at GoodNightJournal.com  Today, I got sometime to organize things at home myself and now it’s time to be productive.
goodnight665,
goodnight615,
goodnight615,Just Sharing a pic that I took on last Sunday it was really nice whether!
goodnight615,However today it’s was cold all day.
goodnight615,Had to put my jacket to go out.
goodnight615,Worked on new design till now still trying to make it more user friendly.
goodnight615,I been very sleepy all week by some reason so I decide to to sleep little early today now at 10:51pm.
goodnight615,Goodnight!
goodnight615,Good journaling!
goodnight615,
goodnight355,
goodnight355,Because it’s been a while for me to write journal here.
goodnight355,Yes, I have been very lazy lately.
goodnight355,Well, it seems like I have been saying that for every single time I write journal for past couple months.
goodnight355,I feel shame on me for that lol.
goodnight355,Not much going on with my life just same things as usual.
goodnight355,Trying to spend more time on new project that I started months ago and it is finally coming out okay.
goodnight355,It still needs more work but I think it is good to share now with you guys here at goodnightjournal.
goodnight355,So my new project was creating a site for online shopping websites, where you can find online shops, share online shops you like and review them to help others to find ones they need.
goodnight355,As I said, there are many more things have to be done but you are more than welcome to come by and check out the site.
goodnight355,It is www.othoo.com
goodnight355,Feel free to leave any comments, questions or concerns.
goodnight355,Thank you!

goodnight593,
goodnight593,some reason I get little depressed on Sunday night.
goodnight593,couldn’t really focus on anything all day.
goodnight593,skipped the church & meeting instead stayed at my apartment all day long watching Netflix.
goodnight593,gotta get back to work but don’t feel like it.
goodnight593,
goodnight565,
goodnight565,I had 12 hours of sleep last night.
goodnight565,woke up at 7:30 AM felt so much better than past couple days.
goodnight565,I didn’t feel tired at all for entire day and started work out again.
goodnight565,I started working on animation on my video.
goodnight565,Today, I got intro and ending done with whole layout for almost 2 min video.
goodnight565,The hardest part comes now all the animation in the middle will probably take me at least full two days to get done.
goodnight565,Also talked the my old boss at the tv station to get the permission to use studio for the video.
goodnight565,ended up exchanging with helping him out something on Saturday.
goodnight565,So I guess I will be able to get the footage on next Saturday and finish up the whole video on Sunday if I get all the animation done before next Saturday.
goodnight565,Seems like I have a lot of time.
goodnight565,for doing this, I kind of have to hold off other projects.
goodnight565,Since I posted a post for hiring a partner for ParkMartini today, I will probably wait till I get my video done and see if I get any response on that post.
goodnight565,well too much thoughts lol
goodnight565,
goodnight279,

goodnight279,Just need to deal with it.
goodnight279,I still have to talk how we are going to do this and figure out what’s exactly gonna happen.
goodnight279,Until then, little bit of stress is expected.
goodnight279,10:01 PM already here in Chicago.
goodnight279,Don’t really feel like I get enough time to do something after work on weekdays.
goodnight279,It will be nice to have flexible work time that I actually believe in to be more productive for employer and employees.
goodnight279,Hopefully, I get that one day!
goodnight279,Feel kind of sleepy already and not sure if I want to mess around with backup thing now or not.
goodnight279,Still little scared doing it since I’m not quite got used to it yet.

goodnight563,I’m so sorry for the inconvenience.
goodnight563,Obviously,  there was an error when we move to the new server from Godday and they did not even know why and how to fix it.
goodnight563,since I don’t have enough knowledge of server side stuffs, I took more time to fix the issue with image upload.
goodnight563,now it’s GOOD TO USE!
goodnight563,I tested several times to see everything works okay but please let me know if you see something does not work properly.
goodnight563,I apologize again for the inconvenience and have good journaling!

goodnight315,Not much to write.
goodnight315,Just one of the typical days.
goodnight315,John finally texted me in the morning but did not say much about what’s going on.
goodnight315,At least I know he’s good.
goodnight315,Not too much projects at work and work out on lunch break.
goodnight315,The weather was great which made me go out for skating after work despite the strong wind.
goodnight315,Skating down to South was amazing.
goodnight315,I felt like I was almost flying with pushing my back.
goodnight315,However, on the way back to North was kind of pain in the ass.
goodnight315,I just took my time to come back.
goodnight315,I could tell tho, my endurance got much better than before.
goodnight315,Stopped by at Jewel to grab something to cook.
goodnight315,Ended up buying steak and cooked it all for tonight and tomorrow’s lunch and maybe more.
goodnight315,It’s 11:34PM now.
goodnight315,Feel little tired cause I had to wake up early today for the phone call.
goodnight315,It went okay but I don’t think it’s gonna happen cause of the different on their budget and what I expect.
goodnight315,Well maybe I regret little but I shouldn’t be cause I know I’m not expecting too much.
goodnight315,It’s time to start again.
goodnight315,Get some exciting projects and make it happen.
goodnight315,Started my first review on WP theme.
goodnight315,I still don’t think I’m ready for it but I could get some help form others on the chat which worked out pretty good.
goodnight315,While I was doing it I found out that I learned a lot for doing that.
goodnight315,I should utilize some of my free time to do the theme review.
goodnight315,I believe this will help improve my skill sets and aesthetic sense.
goodnight315,I think I want to get better at this so another one tomorrow!
goodnight315,that’s pretty much it for my Tuesday!

goodnight315,
goodnight426,
goodnight426,Today, I woke up at 7 in the morning and got church at 8 am to help Eddi moving from South West suburb to North side of Chicago.
goodnight426,I always like helping people out so I decided to spend my Saturday helping him moving.
goodnight426,there were 3 other people came to help.
goodnight426,We drove an hour to get there load everything to truck and unload everything back at the high rise apartment in Lakeview.
goodnight426,Long story short it was fun to meet new people and feels good to be able to helping someone out but I just got too tired lol.
goodnight426,Finished everything got back home right before 5pm.
goodnight426,All I want right now is just stay  at home maybe watch some tv and have a long sleep lol I probably have to move too end of April and I don’t really know if I want to do it or not.
goodnight426,
goodnight443,
goodnight443,I still don’t really know what’s going on but I see lots of social feeds talking about figure skating today at Sochi Olympic.
goodnight443,So people are saying there were miss judgement on final event which gave most famous Korean skater Yuna Kim a silver medal instead of gold.
goodnight443,Yes when Korea people get angry they make a website down.
goodnight443,For this time, petition for re-evaluation.
goodnight443,pretty cool isn’t it?
goodnight443,I wish she won the gold medal but it’s already finalized and I don’t think it’s gonna be changed.
goodnight443,Anyways, I had very typical day as usual.
goodnight443,It was raining all day in Chicago over 40 degrees all day.
goodnight443,just one more days to go before the weekend!
goodnight443,I don’t know why but seems like my apartment management office has very bad system for keeping the record.
goodnight443,My building owner called me yesterday and said I did not pay security deposit and last month rent which I did.
goodnight443,So today I have to take pictures of all those receipts and email them to him.
goodnight443,Don’t really like extra works like that.
goodnight443,Well just wanted to write it down what happened today.
goodnight443,working on parkMartini for the cool concept called “Random Shot” check it out 
goodnight443,http://parkmartini.com/random-shot/
goodnight443,
goodnight526,

goodnight526,New axles I got from online finally arrived today n I was able to put new wheels n bareings today.
goodnight526,Feel good to see my inline got ready to roll again.

goodnight428,It was like 80 degrees couole daya ago and now it’s snowing.
goodnight428,What a amazing weather.
goodnight428,I got a lot to do tonight.
goodnight428,More revision for book cover, reply email to ebay, and estimate for the new project and dinner with my friend.
goodnight428,I dont know how am I going to do all that but I have to make it.
goodnight428,
goodnight639,
goodnight639,I tend to get depressed little bit but on Sunday night by no reason.
goodnight639,It just happens whenever I stay home on Sunday night like today.
goodnight639,Well I watched some movies n had some drinks myself n now I’m tired enough to go to sleep.
goodnight639,I don’t know y I get depressed on Sunday night.
goodnight639,I should be or want to be excited for the beginning of new week like when I was in Cali.
goodnight639,
goodnight538,
goodnight538,Finally it came.
goodnight538,Instead of hating it, I decided to enjoy this freezing weather.
goodnight538,have a good day everyone!
goodnight538,
goodnight339,
goodnight339,I realized today that the more I see things, the more I want.
goodnight339,All those nice things out there... Better Apartment, better neighborhood, better lifestyle well not too much about nicer cars but all those things make me want them so bad.
goodnight339,I guess I just want to be at the better position in my life which I always wanted.
goodnight339,I have the goals in my life but it doesn’t seem like I’m achieving any of those for past couple years.
goodnight339,All those trying and waiting got me frustrated sometimes like today.
goodnight339,Although I know I won’t give up trying, I can’t just ignore these feelings.
goodnight339,I’m thinking and waiting every single moments to get something better and hope that’s gonna happen soon.
goodnight339,Maybe I’m driving to wrong direction or does not have the right car that can speed up on my expectation.
goodnight339,However, I can’t really tell what went wrong or it’s just taking really long time.
goodnight339,Well, what am I missing here?
goodnight339,
goodnight496,
goodnight496,I have been eating crazy from last night.
goodnight496,All I did today was eating and sleeping all day long.
goodnight496,My apartment smells like meat I need to slow down little bit 
goodnight496,
goodnight485,
goodnight485,It was just one of other days that I do my things.
goodnight485,Work till 6 PM, gym on my lunch break, drove an hour to get back to home, dinner myself and writing a journal online.
goodnight485,trying to think something to write but can’t think of anything cause it was just same day as usual days.
goodnight485,At least I did not have a bad day lol how was your day?
goodnight485,
goodnight365,
goodnight365,It’s been a long time that I’m writing diary here.
goodnight365,Well that makes me feel really lazy.
goodnight365,I don’t know that I have been being lazy or not.
goodnight365,It feels like I have a lot going on lately.
goodnight365,New website project that I have been working on and lots of thoughts in my head kind of drive me crazy.
goodnight365,However, still it just doesn’t make sense for me to skip writing diary for this long.
goodnight365,Now that I’m writing things down, I kind of realize how I spent my free time lately and it was very unproductive.
goodnight365,At some point, my goal has become blurry and I kind of forgetting where my destination is in my life.
goodnight365,It seems like I just kept thinking about same daily routine of my life and get bored on that instead of preparing and building things for my future.
goodnight365,I really need to get back on the track and get motivated again for myself and my loved ones.
goodnight365,I gotta stop wasting time and start doing things that benefits for my future.
goodnight365,I guess I start with my new project Othoo.com.
goodnight365,Full launch by first day of November/2014.
goodnight365,Get at least 10 online shops under each category and of course get all the necessary functionally done.
goodnight365,As I more work on this, I get the feeling that this will work if I build&maintain it right.
goodnight365,So yeah Let’s do this.
goodnight365,

goodnight406,The first Road Rave this year last night.
goodnight406,I was worried about raining but it wasn’t rain enough to cancel the skating.
goodnight406,We got 25 people gathered up at Daley Center and skated around city for 2 hours.
goodnight406,It was crazy fun.
goodnight406,Skating makes me feel good and skating with people in the city makes me feel even better.
goodnight406,We had a lot of fun skating around city for 10 miles.
goodnight406,I also got to visit Pilson that I have never been.
goodnight406,The new restaurant was okay that giving out lots of nuts.

goodnight406,Well great night!
goodnight406,Today, I worked on the internet again to make it faster and it seems to be working pretty good so far!
goodnight406,Met Damon and Brian for the game for an hour.

goodnight717,Apparently, today is the day.

goodnight440,I was trying to define problem to him then I realized that not even myself know exactly what is the problem that holding me down.
goodnight440,So I failed to explain that to me but got his card has email address on it.
goodnight440,From last night, I tried to find the problem that I can ask him to advice but It’s still not clear to me.
goodnight440,I’m just struggling now.
goodnight440,Maybe I need to get away from this for little bit to get refreshed.
goodnight440,Well tonight, I just gonna watch Jimmy Kimmel Live.

goodnight489,
goodnight489,It’s snowing again here in Chicago n it’s been accumulated over 5 inches I believe.

goodnight489,I wish I’m in ski resort now.
goodnight489,Went to see my dentist today to get cleaning but she refused to do it cause of my cold sore n gave me an orniment for it.

goodnight414,Weird cause I went to bed around 9:30PM last night and it’s 3 hours earlier than usual.

goodnight414,Hopefully, something exciting thing happens this weekend.

goodnight392,We had World cup theme Road Rave last night and it was fun as usual.
goodnight392,Some reason tho everyone got really tired after the skating.
goodnight392,We were assuming if was the very moisturized weather but no one really knows.

goodnight392,

goodnight447,Another week has began.
goodnight447,I felt like going work after the long vacation cause of the short snowboard trip.
goodnight447,Maybe I need a real vacation so I don’t feel like that for the one day trip to Wisconsin.
goodnight447,It was snowing in the morning but went away in couple hours and the weather was still freaking cold.
goodnight447,I still feel little tired and I don’t think I was on a condition that I usually have on normal days.
goodnight447,just need one more day to recover.
goodnight447,Drive right back to home after work.

goodnight572,website, probably the way I should go but still do not have anything I need.
goodnight572,always thinking about it but too lazy to actually do something about it.
goodnight572,for past couple days, I had been very lazy and I don’t like it at all.
goodnight572,Even though, I know that I have to keep going and put more time on my projects, it is so hard to do that.
goodnight572,most of time, I ended up just going out instead or watch movie and sleep.
goodnight572,How can I be motivated again.

goodnight345,It does not mean I just expect something.
goodnight345,I expect something that I have been putting my time for, something I have been trying for.
goodnight345,It feels kind of like waiting for the test result that I took yesterday.
goodnight345,Full of expectation gets me going but sometime gets me little frustrated when I don’t get the result I want.
goodnight345,Maybe it is just my life that I try something to get what I want and waiting with expectations.
goodnight345,What expectations you have on your daily life?
goodnight345,
goodnight578,
goodnight578,Godaddy put me on the old server till now cause I signed up like 5 years ago.

goodnight287,My diary for January/02/2016
goodnight287,The second day of 2016.
goodnight287,It was freezing below 32 degree weather but the sun was out all day.
goodnight287,I had to go out with my skate on since the sun is out.
goodnight287,However, low temperature made it harder to skate plus the wind.
goodnight287,I skated for 9.9 miles along the lake.
goodnight287,Although it was freezing and my skating muscles are hibernating, it was a lot of fun.
goodnight287,I don’t know if I can live without this.
goodnight287,I finally had a good and long sleep today.
goodnight287,I woke up after 1 PM and went out for skating.
goodnight287,Back home around 3:30 then headed out to Everybody’s coffee again with my laptop.
goodnight287,I stopped by here to grab Chai latte when I got out for skating.
goodnight287,I have been here for over 3 hours now and got a lot done.
goodnight287,My plugin update, entering skating events to othoo.com, got dates for Chicago skating and updating content on GoodnightJournal.com.
goodnight287,I still need to do backup on this site and I’m not sure if I’m gonna feel like doing it tonight when I get home but this has to be done soon.
goodnight287,6:34 PM and it’s dark outside already.
goodnight287,No plans for rest of the day.
goodnight287,I will probably take off soon to home and grab something for dinner on the way.

goodnight669,Emily – age 8
goodnight669,‘Love is what’s in the room with you at Christmas if you stop opening presents

goodnight669,And the final one
goodnight669,The winner was a four year old child whose next door neighbor was an elderly gentleman who had recently lost his wife.
goodnight669,Upon seeing the man cry , the little boy went into the old gentleman’s yard , climbed onto his lap , and just sat there..
goodnight669,When his Mother asked what he had said to the neighbor , the little boy said ,
goodnight669,‘Nothing , I just helped him cry’ 
goodnight669,When there is nothing left but God , that is when you find out that God is all you need.
goodnight669,Take 60 seconds and give this a shot!
goodnight669,All you do is simply say the following small prayer for the person who sent you this.
goodnight669,Heavenly Father , please bless all my friends in whatever it is that You know they may be needing this day!
goodnight669,And may their life be full of Your peace , prosperity and power as he/she seeks to have a closer relationship with You.
goodnight669,Amen .
goodnight669,Then send it on to five other people , Within hours you caused a multitude of people to pray for other people.
goodnight669,Then sit back and watch the power of God work in your life.
goodnight669,P. S. Five is good , but more is better..
goodnight669,God Bless You!
goodnight669,Thank you to Olga for sharing this with me:)

goodnight601,Had to say goodbye to my car that I drove around all over the place for like 6 years.
goodnight601,
goodnight619,
goodnight619,I believe it’s very important to keep your promises.
goodnight619,some people just keep breaking promises like nothing and insist they didn’t do anything wrong.
goodnight619,that’s just so wrong it means they don’t respect others at all.
goodnight619,hope people know that it’s very important to make a promises then actually keeping it because you should not make a promises if you can’t keep it.
goodnight619,I understand there are some circumstances that you can’t keep it.
goodnight619,However, you can’t let that happen over and over again.
goodnight619,you will just become a faithless person if you do that.
goodnight619,how about start with saying sorry when you couldn’t keep the promises you made instead of saying bullshits.
goodnight619,
goodnight517,
goodnight517,I kind of have been taking pics all day as I go places and want to share it with all of you.

goodnight701,

goodnight252,https://www.goodnightjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/07-Stella-gemella.mp3
goodnight252,I just found some days ago but I decided to listen to it just now lol.
goodnight252,The song is called, Stella Gemella by Eros Ramazzotti.
goodnight252,I love the instrumental soft rock behind it and of course the meaning of the lyrics 
goodnight252,
goodnight263,
goodnight263,why?
goodnight263,I don’t get breaks
goodnight263,Indian Lady (boss) messes with my brain telling me this when in reality it was that
goodnight263,I do most of the stuff
goodnight263,Morning Jobs are not for me, can’t help but to feel so fucking lazy ugh...
goodnight263,I only get a day off
goodnight263,My foot just hurt so bad
goodnight263, 
goodnight263,
goodnight265,
goodnight265,Its so hard to not feeling jealous when the guy I have feelings for couldn’t spend time with me last week because he was with the same woman and babysitting the kid.
goodnight265,I don’t want to feel disappointed anymore but I am....
goodnight265,
goodnight270,
goodnight270,Whenever my friend mentions his lover, I wish I could had a lover to stop feeling jealous all the time..
goodnight270,I often get sad when I see pics of naked couples around tumblr or love scenes  because I imagine my friend and her together 
goodnight270, 
goodnight270,It’s hard to move on by I will because it makes me sick to cry for some stupid crush shit
goodnight270,
goodnight269,
goodnight269,After a long late night yesterday, I woke up and it was so boring like plain boring today.
goodnight269,OMG, I just want to this day get over and fucking sleep!!!
goodnight269,I forgot to mention that I love my late Christmas gift from my friend, Michael.
goodnight269,I got 2 PostSecret books on Friday (yesterday) but the funny thing is that he gave me the first edition that I already own (never told him about it).
goodnight269,I wondered, out of the 6-7 books why he chose that one lol?!?!?!
goodnight269,I was about to tell him that but you know what?
goodnight269,I won’t because I plan to sell the book that I bought and keep the one he gave me :).
goodnight269,Finally,  we spent the rest of the night watching hockey, a movie, and telling each other goodnights.
goodnight269,He’s such a nice man, friend that I’m very lucky to have him and I don’t want to be away from him anymore.
goodnight269,If I were capable of having a bf, it would be him without a doubt..
goodnight269, 
goodnight269,
goodnight273,
goodnight273,I wonder why people are surprised that I’m 22 and never had worked in my life?!
goodnight273,Is not like I’m 32 and never had worked lol.
goodnight273,I hope one of two out 3 that I applied will call me soon because I just need money. 
goodnight273, 
goodnight273,
goodnight257,
goodnight257,I’m very sad right now because I’m afraid that I may have some sort of mental disorder because of the following things I’m experiencing:
goodnight257,My memory sucks, I’m forgetful
goodnight257,My mood swings change frequently 
goodnight257,I’m depressive
goodnight257,I get distracted easily
goodnight257,I get nervously tense
goodnight257, 
goodnight257, 
goodnight257, 
goodnight257,
goodnight250,
goodnight250,When I meet people, I always think you prefer someone else or meet someone else than me...that’s why I don’t socialize much, to avoid personal preference
goodnight250,
goodnight258,
goodnight258,Everytime he gives me suggestion on how to pursuit men I meet, it makes me sad to know that he doesn’t get jealous anymore.
goodnight258,I wish he could tell me things that indicate he still interested in me but since he met other girl 11 months back, I’m defeated.......there’s nothing I can do about it anymore....
goodnight258,I still wonder what does she has that I don’t have 
goodnight258,I often scare to tell him, what do you like about her or what made her interesting that you decided to met her and still being with her even if she sucks so often 
goodnight258, 
goodnight258,

goodnight262,Being illegal sucks because you don’t have the fair treatments and people (most) are racist towards us (Mexican illegals).
goodnight262,I want to be able to travel the world but with legal documents as many do.
goodnight262,Besides, for the past 14 years nothing has gone well in my life and I just want to start over in my native country from zero, a new beginning.
goodnight262,If I finally decide to move, it will take me time to get use to my country but don’t worry, I’m making my research.
goodnight262,Its something that I really have to think about it before leaving the US permanently.
goodnight262,Here are some of my reasons why I want to leave US:
goodnight262,
goodnight262,I want to be able to have a proper ID without showing my consular card, because I feel embarrass that people take a look and say (don’t really say :P) “oh she’s illegal” or  “hmmm” ( long stare if they’re able to make it eligible).
goodnight262,Work legally and without filling an application with fake ssn when I seek jobs.
goodnight262,Able to have like health insurance (ex.
goodnight262,medicaid, chip or any plan)
goodnight262,Be able to find a job that I’m comfortable with without the harassment
goodnight262,Able to drive with proper documentation
goodnight262,Able to have for once, citizen rights like many
goodnight262,To Travel to Europe, a long wish that I want so bad
goodnight262,I also want to be able to see the rest of my family before grandma passes away in the future
goodnight262,Be able to have a  proper life for myself and to be free of my sadness and disappointments.
goodnight262,For once, I want to be happy.
goodnight262,I’ll see what happens in a couple of months....
goodnight262, 
goodnight262,
goodnight264,
goodnight264,I judge people easily...I try not to but it seems a bit of hard work not to
goodnight264,
goodnight261,
goodnight261,I started at my new job today and honestly, is very exhausting because I had to clean at least 20-30 rooms!
goodnight261,The lady who is training me seem a bit “mean” , I guess she didn’t like me much.
goodnight261,Other than that, its not a bad start at housekeeping job.
goodnight261,I only need to learn how to clean the rooms properly and I’m good to go :). 
goodnight261,
goodnight267,
goodnight267,Second day is already more exhausting than day 1 because the lady who is training me expects me to learn already the entire drill!.
goodnight267,I couldn’t hold it and told her that I won’t learn everything in 2 days, shit..drove me mad already and all morning to noon, had done nothing but to told me how I fucked the beds, and how I need to fucking hurry up!.
goodnight267,Me, kept telling her back and to be honest I won’t put up with her attitude.
goodnight267,Just because I’m illegal, I won’t let anyone to treat me “bad” at work or to make me feel less!
goodnight267,For day 2, I already memorize how to clean the bathrooms, clean the furniture, and vacuum the room.
goodnight267,The only issues I have is how to do the bed and the color coding list of rooms that I have to do bed or not, and which bed sheets to grab.
goodnight267,oh, also how to be much faster and get less tired.
goodnight267,I highly don’t  recommend hotels to anyone, especially if its less than 3.5 rating
goodnight267, 
goodnight267,Reasons why: (about my hotel)
goodnight267,Poor hygiene
goodnight267,The people who are staying for more than 2 days, they get dirty bed sheets.
goodnight267,Pillows are so dirty from inside the pillow covers.
goodnight267,No gloves when cleaning
goodnight267,Lack of staff
goodnight267,Poor hotel sanitary overall
goodnight267,Old furnitures
goodnight267,*2 days and this job is so exhausting that I want to quit

goodnight266,On Friday, my mom’s lover died and I feel bad because I often talked bad about him with my sister judging him by the way he looked and his job.
goodnight266,It was a very shocking news to me because it was one of the things I never expected and mom was beyond devastated, she’s doing alright but it will take her time to heal though.
goodnight266,I’m there to help whenever I can and what she needs.
goodnight266,On Monday, I got a called from another job that I had applied and told me to go on Tuesday (Wings fast food restaurant) and I didn’t like it.
goodnight266,I felt very pressure when both men who were teaching left me alone there, trying to do about 8-10 orders by myself that I didn’t know how to do them :(.
goodnight266,Overwhelm by the ladies upfront asking me to “hurry” and I just took off my apron and told another worker to let me go out.
goodnight266,I lasted working there for 4.5 hours.
goodnight266,Then, a lady worker and the boss came to ask me what had happened.
goodnight266,I told them that It became too much and my feet hurt very bad :(.
goodnight266,They talked me through how I shouldn’t feel down and told me I could comeback tomorrow (today).
goodnight266,I decided not to, I feel embarrass to go back again.
goodnight266,The same day (Monday), I got paid for the first time!!!
goodnight266,It feels so good to have money in my wallet 😀
goodnight266,Last Week, there’s a man who caught my eyes last week at work (hotel) and he’s very hot, gorgeous.
goodnight266,Well, actually never seen him but I just remembering that I have been cleaning his room but just saw him some days ago (face and everything).
goodnight266,My problem is that I don’t know how to make him notice or how to “talk” to him lol.
goodnight266,I think he wouldn’t be attracted to a housekeeper like me and to be honest, I’m not that pretty either :P. I fantasize about him sexually.
goodnight266,It would be nice to enter his room and fuck him like seriously though.
goodnight266,I want a man/men but I don’t know how to, I only want it to take the stress away of life...
goodnight266,
goodnight271,
goodnight271,Tomorrow, I’ll go search for work because I need money as fuck to buy more makeup 😛

goodnight254,I want you to never forget me...(2x)
goodnight254,If you don’t find special words to tell me, please don’t worry I can understand...for me, it’s enough to know that you are thinking about me even for a minute because I’ll be satisfied if you send a greeting...its enough a little to feel closer..(2x)
goodnight254,Write me, when the clear sky shines again and the days will be longer but you don’t wait at night...

goodnight251,My mom went to a funeral of his lover and was telling me how his body was cold and frozen :(.
goodnight251,She said that it made her sad seeing him like this for the last time.
goodnight251,I often think about death since my friend (who I have feelings for) had a crash.
goodnight251,In the back of my mind, I want to end this “friendship” because I wouldn’t like to receive the news that he passed away.
goodnight251,He’s over there (Canada) and me over here (USA).
goodnight251,Since I’m illegal, it will be impossible for me to visit him there :'(.
goodnight251,The idea of his death, tears me apart when I think about it.
goodnight251,I don’t like this.
goodnight251,I hate death and most of it, the fucking distance!!
goodnight251,!
goodnight251,
goodnight260,
goodnight260,It has been 4 days since I started working and I’m completely dead all day.
goodnight260,I have understood 70% of the duties that I have to do daily and I want to quit so bad already.
goodnight260,Cleaning rooms is the most unpleasant thing!!!
goodnight260,The bad thing is that guests like me because I’m the only one who can speak fully English and I literally a miracle.
goodnight260,A guy gave me $5 to clean all his room when today I was only supposed to take the trash and add additional towels, good thing tho :).
goodnight260,My mom tells me that even if I quit this job, every single job is exhausting anyways.
goodnight260,Tomorrow, it will be one of the  busiest day and I don’t wanna go :(.
goodnight260,I feel like I haven’t talk to my friend, Michael in a longtime (only 2 days) and I hope we can watch a movie tonight because I miss him all the time.
goodnight260,I hate that I like him alot :(, what can I do!?!?
goodnight260,he is just too nice to me and so kind, I’m overwhelm *-*
goodnight260,
goodnight256,
goodnight256,I often think about my future and its scares me to think I’ll have a dead end job, no education, be scared all the time and no place to live in....
goodnight256,
goodnight255,
goodnight255,It’s been almost a week and a half and I still don’t get a job.
goodnight255,No calls, no interviews, nothing..it makes me sad because the another year will pass and I still will be a fucking loser.
goodnight255,I’m out options for now.
goodnight255,Studying for the GED is really hard because I often lazy and get sleep halfway through and end up studying for only 30 mins.
goodnight255,Right now, I could had study but I’m not or hours ago but I didn’t.
goodnight255,I still lack so much motivation as well as to lose weight!!
goodnight255,I’m often scare of the future because I’m wasting it huge and I don’t know what to do.
goodnight255,I just don’t want to have anymore mistakes nor regrets.
goodnight255,I’m lost...At 22, I should know what to do in my fucking life, to have my shit on..( in my opinion ).
goodnight255,I’m not complaining, I’m reviewing my own thoughts.
goodnight255,That’s all
goodnight255,I hate how life is complicated lol 
goodnight255,
goodnight272,
goodnight272,I finished watching Turbo Kid with my “friend”, Michaël.
goodnight272,I was surprised how I love this funny quirky movie!
goodnight272,He recommended for us to watch it but I was highly skeptical of his choice because sci-fi comedy is not really my thing.
goodnight272,I was wrong :).
goodnight272,Just some minutes ago, we talked about it and told each others goodnight.
goodnight272,For tonight, I’m a happy girl even if I felt some sort of shitty hours ago.
goodnight272,He knows how to make me feel definitely better and the fact that he was smiling because I wanted to watch a movie with him is priceless.
goodnight272,Our days together will be over in 2 weeks because he will return to work at nights everyday after a car crash that left him temporarily injured.
goodnight272,I’m glad he’s alive and he’s feeling better each day 😀 <3
goodnight272,

goodnight14,Having a droopy day a little bit.
goodnight14,Not complaining, mind you.
goodnight14,I have nothing to complain about, thank God.
goodnight14,I’m just sleepy and can’t go to sleep because I need to go meet my grandsons’ bus shortly.
goodnight14,Which I love to do.
goodnight14,Maybe I just need some chocolate !
goodnight14,(smile) Hope your day is going well, too.
goodnight14,
goodnight42,
goodnight42,Wow, it is snowing here and it is SO pretty.
goodnight42,It reminds me of the verse that says though our sins be as scarlet, they shall be whiter than snow.
goodnight42,A comforting thought.
goodnight42,Part of the beautiful truth!
goodnight42,
goodnight32,
goodnight32,Thank You, God for Sundays.
goodnight32,A little bit of rest in the rush of the week.
goodnight32,Church is good and we look forward to going.
goodnight32,You are so good, God.
goodnight32,If I tried to list all your blessings, my computer would explode!
goodnight32,I love You, Jesus.
goodnight32,Not ashamed to publish it.

goodnight41,“Sunday morning very early, while my dad was sleeping, we would walk down to Your house without speaking.”
goodnight41,Anybody remember this song from Peter, Paul and Mary?

goodnight16,
goodnight16,I wrote about my grandson leaving his jacket on the school bus.
goodnight16,He is autistic and he had a meltdown about it.
goodnight16,But today he got the jacket back, so I am praising the good Lord, because that Spiderman jacket is really important to my grandson.
goodnight16,God is so good.

goodnight19,
goodnight19,The trip to the mortuary was okay.
goodnight19,Nobody cried or teared up.
goodnight19,My mom is still so basically healthy that we could feel we won’t need a casket for years.
goodnight19,My sister actually told her “You’re going to live to be 100.”  Afterwards we went to Wendy’s for lunch.
goodnight19,Thank you to anyone who prayed.
goodnight19,It made it so easy.

goodnight36,I love this time of day.....twilight.
goodnight36,Soon I can go to bed and rest.
goodnight36,It’s been a wonderful day, but I am tired.
goodnight36,Ready for that soft pillow and warm blanket I have been so blessed with.
goodnight36,Yes, I do think of the homeless ones sometimes when I go to bed so safe and secure.
goodnight36,I pray for them.
goodnight36,When I had trouble with anorexia some years back, I didn’t dare think of the starving children in third world countries.
goodnight36,I would lose any scrap of appetite I had.
goodnight36,So I learned to help in whatever way I can, and then just be grateful.
goodnight36,I am so thankful for what I have—-a small home, a wonderful husband, a love of music, art and writing, a relationship with Jesus.
goodnight36,Life really is good.
goodnight36,If you let it be.
goodnight36,
goodnight47,
goodnight47,
goodnight47,This is my first book, written for a young adult audience.

goodnight47,Thank you!

goodnight2,
goodnight2,I worry that some of you still have not really met Jesus one-to-one—-you and Jesus alone.
goodnight2,We may spend time in chapel—but have you seen with the eyes of your soul how he looks at you with love?
goodnight2,Do you really know the living Jesus—not from the books but from being with him in your heart?
goodnight2,Have you heard the loving words he speaks to you?
goodnight2,Ask for the grace; he is longing to give it.
goodnight2,
goodnight13,
goodnight13,It really is possible to find peace after a devastated childhood.
goodnight13,God is my real Father, my good Father.
goodnight13,And He is always “there” for me.
goodnight13,He is the Healer.

goodnight25,I found  a tiny vase of daffodils—four
goodnight25,Just inside my kitchen door.
goodnight25,My mother put them there, I knew.
goodnight25,My mother, an angel of ninety-two.
goodnight25,One day the blossoms began to wilt,
goodnight25,They began to look like yellow silk.
goodnight25,And finally they turned paper-thin;
goodnight25,Just like my  mother’s aging skin.
goodnight25,Thank you, mother, for still being here.
goodnight25,And bringing little gifts of cheer.
goodnight25,
goodnight35,
goodnight35,That’s a Bible verse.
goodnight35,I helped out a bit when he needed money, and came by asking for work.
goodnight35,I over paid him, because his need seemed so great.
goodnight35,Since then he has come asking for more money.
goodnight35,I’m afraid I’m an easy touch, and don’t make wise decision.
goodnight35,We’re on limited income ourselves.
goodnight35,God, help me know the right things to do.
goodnight35,
goodnight30,
goodnight30,We need to know and remember that each person has a special light shining from their heart out into the world.
goodnight30,When you love someone, this light gets very bright.
goodnight30,It can be your parents, your boyfriend or girlfriend, your mate, your baby.....there are people everywhere who need the light only you can give.
goodnight30,Shine on!
goodnight30,
goodnight29,
goodnight29,Well....after all that about loving bedtime, I cannot sleep.
goodnight29,I went to bed but I am wide awake, so I got up to journal some more.
goodnight29,Someone out there needs an encouraging journal entry.
goodnight29,Romans 8:38  “For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor height nor depth nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.”  Put simply, Nothing can separate us from God’s love.
goodnight29,Nothing.
goodnight29,This is Jesus’s gift to us.  
goodnight29,
goodnight4,
goodnight4,On Sundays, whenever possible, my mom (age 92) and I go visit local nursing homes and I play hymns for them to sing.
goodnight4,I play “Old time favorites” like Love Lifted me, I’ll fly Away, I’ve got a Mansion, —-things you’ve probably never heard of.
goodnight4,Old hymns.
goodnight4,They like those best.
goodnight4,Today someone made announcement that Hazel died yesterday, a large black woman who loved to sing with us.
goodnight4,She had been too sick to join us for a long while.
goodnight4,But her favorite hymn was Jesus Loves Me, so we sang that in her honor.
goodnight4,That was my Sunday.
goodnight4,Besides that Matthew (age 14) lay in the floor at church using my jacket for a pillow and slept for about 45 minutes in church today.
goodnight4,(smile)  Life is good.

goodnight8,
goodnight8,My hubby has a doctor appointment at 8:00 a.m. Thursday and my mom has a doctor appointment elsewhere at 8:30.

goodnight27,I need a nap.

goodnight28,It’s morning and that faithful little bird outside my window is chirping away.
goodnight28,It is worth waking up to hear him.
goodnight28,I wonder what Heaven is like?
goodnight28,I’m sure there will be birds singing.

goodnight3,I just realized this coming Sunday is Palm Sunday!
goodnight3,I have been racing around so much, it “snuck” up on me.
goodnight3,I’ll have to plan something pretty out of my closet for Easter Sunday.
goodnight3,I don’t buy new clothes for Easter.
goodnight3,I love Easter it is my favorite Christian Celebration Day!

goodnight46,I am excited to share my books with you, especially The Beautiful Truth.
goodnight46,God gave me the material to write about.
goodnight46,It’s all true.
goodnight46,The title comes from a darling black lady in a nursing home I used to visit who would comment on God’s goodness and His love, and conclude “Honey, it’s the beautiful truth!”  And it is!
goodnight46,She built my faith very much, and I want to share the happiness and rest that can be found when we really believe in Jesus’ LOVE for us.
goodnight46,Not just His love for everybody, but His unique love for YOU.
goodnight46,The book tells you how to discover this and other encouraging notes.
goodnight46,It’s available at Amazon.com, Barnes and Noble, and Westbow Press, IN (a division of Thomas Nelson.
goodnight46,)  I hope you will get a copy and read it!
goodnight46,It is full of joy and a few miracles (smile).

goodnight17,One chapter in my book talks about hearts-ease.
goodnight17,The word comes from a tiny flower which looks like  a miniature pansy; nowadays it is called viola.
goodnight17,But I love the old-fashioned name because it signifies so much.
goodnight17,I talk in the book about how we all need hearts-ease, rest for our souls, and peace.
goodnight17,And how we can learn to find it.
goodnight17,I hope you will buy it on Amazon or Barnes & Noble—-I know you will enjoy it.
goodnight17,Meanwhile, I wish you all hearts-ease, from my heart.

goodnight26,Today I go with my mom to look at caskets.
goodnight26,This was her idea.
goodnight26,She’s 92 and has some health issues, and she wants to get everything “ready” so it won’t be a burden on my sister and me.
goodnight26,Bless her heart.
goodnight26,She is always thinking of others, not herself.
goodnight26,There was a time we had trouble getting along (happens in almost every family, doesn’t it?
goodnight26,)  But for years now I have seen what a stellar person she is and a doting mother and grandmother.
goodnight26,I am SO thankful to God that He melted any foolish resentment that used to be in my young heart.
goodnight26,I love my mom SO much now, for years.
goodnight26,I can’t imagine life without her.
goodnight26,She keeps trying to prepare me.
goodnight26,She’ll say “I can’t last forever.”  I tell her, “Try, please.” So she tries by exercising and eating broccoli and other good food and taking vitamins and her medicines.
goodnight26,She is truly wonderful.
goodnight26,I hope I don’t make a fool of myself and cry at the mortuary.
goodnight26,I want to help her pick out the casket because she wants just the cheapest thing they have and my sister and I want something pretty and soft and white.
goodnight26,Think about me around 10:30 if you read this.
goodnight26,A prayer would be so appreciated.

goodnight22,God, does your light shine through?
goodnight22,Do any but my closest friends know?
goodnight22,Daily I promise You my heart, then go
goodnight22,scattering my hours in idleness, dear God.
goodnight22,I dream of Heaven, but seek things below;
goodnight22,earthly treasures that shine and glow.
goodnight22,I need to be with You
goodnight22,so that you’ll know
goodnight22,I love you.
goodnight22,I do,

goodnight24,I am so delighted because I have experienced such a closeness to Him from doing just that.
goodnight24,I have literally a foot-locker full of journals that are prayers and conversations with my Lord.

goodnight45,Okay, confession:  that is only half the poem.
goodnight45,I got tired of having to readjust the font to 18 for every single line.
goodnight45,Hope somebody enjoys reading this anyhow.
goodnight45,It’s part of The Beautiful Truth.
goodnight45,Blessings to all!

goodnight10,My mother gave me a birthstone ring for my birthday in January.
goodnight10,I wear it all the time.
goodnight10,A garnet.
goodnight10,She didn’t buy it online or at Walmart, she went to the Mall to a jewelry store.
goodnight10,When I was growing up, my dad was absentee and sent no child support.
goodnight10,My grandmother raised me because Mom had to work 6 days a week and we went to church on Sundays and then she slept most of the afternoon.
goodnight10,But I know she loves me—-if not then, then now.
goodnight10,The ring represents her love.
goodnight10,I will always cherish it.
goodnight10,
goodnight40,
goodnight40,Hi again!
goodnight40,What a busy day today!
goodnight40,How was your day?
goodnight40,I hope all is well.
goodnight40,God bless you.

goodnight37,“Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father which is in Heaven.”—Jesus
goodnight37,We all have light within us.
goodnight37,You can share your light by just giving someone a smile.
goodnight37,Being happy, being creative and being kind all make your light brighter.
goodnight37,Have a sunshiny day, friends!

goodnight12,I read a lot of blogs about a guy or gal breaking someone’s heart.
goodnight12,A family member can break your heart, too, not even meaning to.
goodnight12,That’s what Yesterday was all about.
goodnight12,He wouldn’t hurt me for the world.
goodnight12,But when he’s hurting, I hurt.
goodnight12,Comments?

goodnight43,Hi!
goodnight43,My name is Lynn and I am here for you.
goodnight43,The love of my life is Jesus Christ.
goodnight43,He is the Love of your life, too.
goodnight43,If you would like to submit a prayer request or just tell me how your day is going, I’d love to hear from you.
goodnight43,Blessings!
goodnight43,
goodnight18,
goodnight18,I am so delighted!
goodnight18,I just found out a friend of mine bought six  copies of my book THE BEAUTIFUL TRUTH by Lynn Roberson at Amazon.com to give to friends!
goodnight18,Wow!
goodnight18,I am so happy!
goodnight18,The message of the book is healing because it is about finding peace through the unconditional love of Jesus Christ.
goodnight18,It is not preachy at all.
goodnight18,It’s little stories and anecdotes about how God has intervened in my life to bring me back to Him when I was trying to wander.
goodnight18,It’s funny and heartwarming.
goodnight18,I hope a lot of people will buy it and read it.
goodnight18,Read it is the important part—borrow a copy if you can.

goodnight34,I am blessed with a loving, close family.
goodnight34,My daughter teaches special needs Middle school and has her Master’s degree and is raising her two special needs boys.
goodnight34,I think the boys have brought us all closer together.
goodnight34,It is true that they are a gift from God.
goodnight34,My mother is 92 and still capable in every way.
goodnight34,We have dinner at her home every Friday.
goodnight34,We work hard to keep the family close.
goodnight34,My sister is a music teacher with a master’s in piano performance.
goodnight34,Wow—-you should hear her play the piano!
goodnight34,I am so proud of her.
goodnight34,I play the piano some; my hands are smaller and octaves put a strain on those little muscles in the fingers.
goodnight34,But I enjoy playing.
goodnight34,My brother-in-law is a wonderful person, a retired minister.
goodnight34,My husband is the dearest man in all the world.
goodnight34,And we have a golden retriever who is a sweetheart.
goodnight34,All sound too good to be true?
goodnight34,Well, I’m just telling you the highlights.
goodnight34,We have cloudy days, too, sometimes.
goodnight34,More in the past.
goodnight34,I want to help you think about the highlights in your life, too! 
goodnight34,
goodnight11,
goodnight11,I don’t think I have much to say except the title.
goodnight11,(smile) I hope all my friends who blog here are doing well and keeping your chin up.
goodnight11,Hugs to all.

goodnight15,My grandson cursed at me and told me to leave him alone.
goodnight15,Then I came home and gave my husband the cold shoulder for something he said two days ago that I thought I had forgiven.
goodnight15,Notice the common denominator?
goodnight15,ME.
goodnight15,It reminds me of the old camp song: Not my brother, not my sister, but it’s me, Oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer;  not my preacher, not my teacher, but it’s ME, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer.
goodnight15,Father in Heaven, help me to truly forgive, not just halfway.
goodnight15,Help me not crowd my grandkids.
goodnight15,“Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.”  Psalm 51 I think.
goodnight15,
goodnight31,
goodnight31,We were supposed to get snow, but didn’t.
goodnight31,Some people are glad and others are disappointed.
goodnight31,Especially school children, of course.
goodnight31,I think I’m glad.
goodnight31,I need to get some groceries in today.
goodnight31,Yesterday was a wonderful day for me.
goodnight31,I heard a sermon on TV that made me know we are each chosen by God and blessed and highly favored.
goodnight31,As I listened to the preacher, I could feel his words as truth inside me.
goodnight31,Of course he talked a half hour and I tried to sum it up in a sentence, but what I want you to remember is the beautiful truth that Jesus loves you and is with you in whatever trials you may be going through.
goodnight31,He will bring you through to a better place.
goodnight31,Talk to Him.
goodnight31,Journal to Him.
goodnight31,Believe in Him and feel the glimmer of joy in a new relationship which will bring you only good.
goodnight31,He is the Friend your heart craves.
goodnight31,If you already know Him and belong to Him, know that He loves you tenderly and watchfully, and you can cast all your cares on Him because He cares for you.
goodnight31,Happy day to all!
goodnight31,
goodnight9,
goodnight9,Yesterday (March 13) was my dad’s birthday.
goodnight9,He died several years ago.
goodnight9,I didn’t feel sad on his birthday.
goodnight9,I don’t miss him.
goodnight9,Our relationship was kind of aborted in my early childhood.
goodnight9,I missed him THEN.
goodnight9,But when I met him as an adult it was complicated and uneasy.
goodnight9,It has all been healed by Jesus Christ’s mercy, and instead of grief or resentment or anything else there is only peace in that part of my life now.
goodnight9,Beautiful peace.
goodnight9,Thank you, Lord.
goodnight9,
goodnight5,
goodnight5,I hope things go better with my grandson today.
goodnight5,He is almost 15 and that is a difficult age to be.
goodnight5,I know he takes things hard sometimes.
goodnight5,He is also autistic and maybe bi-polar.
goodnight5,I love him so much.
goodnight5,I take care of him in the afternoons when he gets off the bus until his mom gets home.
goodnight5,Only God can imagine how much I love this child.
goodnight5,
goodnight20,
goodnight20,I’m on my way to meet my grandsons’ bus.
goodnight20,Two buses.
goodnight20,I love this time of the afternoon when I have time with them.
goodnight20,We have a snack, a Bible study and then watch a movie.
goodnight20,He loves movies.
goodnight20,He is such a precious young man.
goodnight20,Fourteen.
goodnight20,He wouldn’t have to have someone meet his bus, but he loves having someone home when he gets there after a long, long day at school.
goodnight20,And it is my pleasure, indeed!
goodnight20,
goodnight7,
goodnight7,Yesterday my autistic grandson left his favorite jacket on the bus, and he had a meltdown.
goodnight7,God bless him.
goodnight7,I thought he was going to run all the way down the road after the school bus.
goodnight7,It scared me to death.
goodnight7,But he only ran up the driveway and then stopped at the corner.
goodnight7,He was distraught.
goodnight7,I know how much he loves that Spiderman jacket.
goodnight7,I had to call his mom to talk him down.
goodnight7,Then he was calm again, took some deep breaths and suddenly lay down and went to sleep.
goodnight7,My heart is heavy today.
goodnight7,I don’t want it to be but it is.
goodnight7,When he is so frantic  and desperate, it just breaks something inside me.
goodnight7,I wish everything could be always right for him.
goodnight7,He’s a very loving boy.
goodnight7,God help him, please.
goodnight7,
goodnight23,
goodnight23,I am still in a mood to talk about Light.
goodnight23,Maybe because it is early morning.
goodnight23,The birds get so happy when the first light breaks, still grey in the sky.
goodnight23,They sing their hearts out.
goodnight23,I am a sleepy-head but I love to hear them.
goodnight23,Doesn’t make me want to jump out of bed, though.
goodnight23,I like to pray in the morning.
goodnight23,And last thing at night.
goodnight23,I wrote a song about it:
goodnight23,I will meet You in the morning
goodnight23,at the first light of the day.
goodnight23,We will walk together in Your garden,
goodnight23,Lord, I come to pray.
goodnight23,I will meet You
goodnight23,In the evening,
goodnight23,at the soft close of the day.
goodnight23,We will walk together in Your garden,
goodnight23,Lord, I come to pray.
goodnight23,
goodnight39,
goodnight39,It is so cold today.
goodnight39,We have had to stay inside mostly just to keep warm.
goodnight39,But it’s been quiet and nice.
goodnight39,I am going to bed early (“early” even for me!)
goodnight39,I hope the phone doesn’t jar me awake like this morning.
goodnight39,Ah, well.
goodnight39,I am thinking of posting some of my poems.
goodnight39,I wonder if anyone would read them, hm?
goodnight39,
goodnight113,
goodnight113,This week has been pretty good.
goodnight113,Thursday was my day off.
goodnight113,Went to the city with The Man.
goodnight113,We walked around the mall for awhile.
goodnight113,I bought myself and The Man coordinated necklaces (mine’s a pentagram inside a circle with the zodiac signs enscribed on the stainless steel).
goodnight113,The Man’s necklace is a pentagram too, but it’s darker than mine.
goodnight113,While we were looking at jewelry I spotted a tee shirt with a kitten puking a rainbow.
goodnight113,It screamed Deedee so I got it for her.
goodnight113,She’s wearing it as I write this blog...
goodnight113,Yesterday was Snoochie’s play “The Elephant Child”.
goodnight113,I loved going to her school and watching her sing.
goodnight113,After the performance The Man and I went to Bojangles (best biscuits EVER).
goodnight113,Then we went to the store and got Snoochie a giant stuffed tiger and 2 shirts.
goodnight113,I couldn’t wait til she got home to surprise her.
goodnight113,I worked last night and it was a big boss shift.
goodnight113,It was actually a very pleasant, smooth evening.
goodnight113,It’s awesome when Big Boss is in a good mood.
goodnight113,So that’s been my weekend so far and all in all, it’s been good!
goodnight113,
goodnight94,
goodnight94,Toothless has been on her medication for 3 days now.
goodnight94,I know this won’t cure the cancer nor save her life, but it will ease her pain.
goodnight94,It’s this gut wrenching ironic twist that the medication is making her feel well enough that she’s moving around and she seems... happy.
goodnight94,It’s a false hope.
goodnight94,It feels cruel almost.
goodnight94,She finally feels relief as the sand pours quickly to the bottom of her hour glass.
goodnight94,I see my sweet baby looking at me with her huge, sparkling, yellow eyes and for the first time in a month or more her pain has subsided.
goodnight94,Her life may be short, but now she has a chance to enjoy the few weeks she has left.
goodnight94,Every time I stroke her fur I feel a pang of sorrow.
goodnight94,I’m going to miss this.
goodnight94,I’m going to miss seeing her shadow creep across the house.
goodnight94,I’m going to miss the way she rolls on to her side and lays her head back so I’ll let her neck.
goodnight94,Meeting her was our destiny.
goodnight94,I did not think our time would be so short.
goodnight94,Facing her imminent death I’ve had to ask myself a hard question.
goodnight94,When Toothless’s spirit leaves her body... what do we do with her body?
goodnight94,We can’t bury her because we are planning on moving and we can’t bring her with us.
goodnight94,I refuse to let the vet dispose of her for us.
goodnight94,She won’t be just some anonymous pet handed over to be incinerated with dogs and cats that’s she’s never known.
goodnight94,We have decided on cremation and we want the remains returned.
goodnight94,We will hike as a family to the top of one of the Blue Ridge Mountains and scatter the ashes of the live she lived into the air.
goodnight94,For a cat that spent her life safely protected inside 4 walls, for the cat that lay on the window sill basked in sunshine nothing seems more appropriate than letting her fly off in breeze with the world to roam.
goodnight94,She will be the sky, the stars, and the ground beneath my feet.
goodnight94,I feel this is the good bye my special friend deserves.
goodnight94,I’ve started calling for quotes.
goodnight94,I have to make sure the places that preform this service are creditable and licensed.
goodnight94,It’s a task that hurts my soul, but it’s so important to my family.
goodnight94,
goodnight92,
goodnight92,I’m starting to drift into the fog again.
goodnight92,My brain gets cloudy and thoughts whirl by like a gust of wind.
goodnight92,Sometimes I can’t fight the electric currents of energy that course through my veins.
goodnight92,It’s the ADHD again and I am forever fighting it.
goodnight92,Maybe it’s just that I had a long week end, consumed at work.
goodnight92,Yes, let’s pretend that’s the only reason why the world gets fuzzy and loses its focus.
goodnight92,I had meant for this journal entry to be about Sloth... but ironically I rather not concentrate all of my energy into a singular topic.
goodnight92,Days like today I’m embracing the free flow.
goodnight92,Saturday night at work went well.
goodnight92,I dug the crew we had on.
goodnight92,After work I had to mad dash 4 towns over and pick up The Man from his own place of employment.
goodnight92,We got home and it was well past 1 am so sleep came easily enough.
goodnight92,Sunday morning bright and early I had to be back at work.
goodnight92,The day started with an interesting turn of events.
goodnight92,Big boss took time and care to explain various procedures in depth with me... things that are truthfuly beyond my realm of responsibilities.
goodnight92,I picked up on the vibe, paid careful attention, but said nothing.
goodnight92,Yes, I’m psychic, but that doesn’t always mean I should trust my intuition.
goodnight92,Sure nuff’ 5 minutes (or less later) big boss asked me how I’d feel about being a manager.
goodnight92,I said yes.
goodnight92,So, we will see where this goes.
goodnight92,Once upon a time I was offered a promotion that was eventually denied to me by a combination of factors 1.
goodnight92,I think I accidentally leeched energy from my then big boss.
goodnight92,2.
goodnight92,I was assaulted by my direct supervisor.
goodnight92,I was po’ed.
goodnight92,I pitched a fit.
goodnight92,3.
goodnight92,Good bye promotion.
goodnight92,Gee, how am I suppose to act when some one shows me around like a rag doll!?!?
goodnight92,It’s in the past now.
goodnight92,I’m over it, I swear.
goodnight92,However promotions now are a huge source of anxiety for me.
goodnight92,It’s the carrot dangling in front of the donkey.
goodnight92,Consider me the donkey.
goodnight92,So.
goodnight92,We will see.
goodnight92,I guess I need to stay in good communication with big boss about this and roll up my sleeves, act like a responsible adult.
goodnight92,My diet lately has been so so.
goodnight92,It’s an improvement so call it a baby step.
goodnight92,On the other hand, I have been exercising a lot.
goodnight92,The soreness doesn’t affect me as much.
goodnight92,I plan on sticking with it.
goodnight92,Today was gorgeous outside!!!
goodnight92,Oh my goodness do I love South Carolina.
goodnight92,It felt and smelled like spring.
goodnight92,I just wanted to be under that blazing sun all day.
goodnight92,The air was so warm and sweet.
goodnight92,The Man and I had our breakfast date this morning.
goodnight92,I got my standard egg whites, bacon, wheat toast, and crispy hash browns.
goodnight92,Yum.
goodnight92,We accidentally overheard our waitress telling her boss that her last table couldn’t pay their whole bill and were 80 cents short + tip.
goodnight92,As a former waitress I took this opportunity to make good on all the fabulous tips I’ve been fortunate enough to receive.
goodnight92,I hope that made our lovely server’s Monday morning a little better.
goodnight92,So... I think that wraps up my past few days.
goodnight92,My tummy is hurting me a little at the moment so I should probably head to bed.
goodnight92,Good night world!

goodnight125, 
goodnight125,Let me start my next ghost story / tale of the big red house with a brief over view about doppelgangers because it is extremely relevant to my own encounter.
goodnight125,Doppelganger
goodnight125,
goodnight125, 
goodnight125, 
goodnight125,A doppelganger is an extremely rare paranormal phenomenon.
goodnight125,The majority of paranormal groups will never become involved in a doppelganger case, but it is one in which we should mention because as rare as it is – it does happen from time to time.
goodnight125,A doppelganger is a physical double of a living person.
goodnight125,The word is derived from German meaning “double walker”.
goodnight125,The term has expanded beyond the paranormal realm and it has become a word to refer to any look-alike of any person.
goodnight125,In paranormal terms, it has a much more mysterious meaning.
goodnight125,Most doppelgangers are experienced when someone catches an image of themselves in their peripheral vision.
goodnight125,In older times, to see your own doppelganger was an omen of your impending death.
goodnight125,(Wasn’t everything a bad omen back then?)
goodnight125,Your doppelganger seen by a friend or family was also considered bad luck and an omen of an approaching illness.
goodnight125,Again in folklore, a doppelganger cast no shadow or reflection and was supposed to advise the person they shadow – often providing misleading and malicious messages.
goodnight125,You may be asking why we are discussing this if this topic was the result of old folklore.
goodnight125,While the folklore seems to be preposterous, there are recorded events of doppelgangers that baffle not only paranormal investigators – but family members and in some instances police officers.
goodnight125,A doppelganger can be the result of energy that a live person has expended that has somehow been recorded and replays itself – like a residual haunting, only with the energy of a live person.
goodnight125,There are many reports of people being haunted by their likenesses reliving some traumatic event in their own lives.
goodnight125,There are also claims of doppelgangers that appear responsive and have an inkling of intelligence to them.
goodnight125,How this occurs is a mystery for all of us.
goodnight125,It is a relatively rare phenomenon and one that needs further research.
goodnight125,A very real possibility for a doppelganger image is a crisis apparition.
goodnight125,A crisis apparition is an image of a living person who is usually in grave danger or injury.
goodnight125,They are able to subconsciously reach out to loved ones, often times many miles away.
goodnight125,The above info is from a site, I’ll give credit to at the end of this post.
goodnight125,Now, let’s go back in time to my childhood and the massive red house I grew up in.
goodnight125,My mom was rather strict with bedtime, but her perfect routine of bath time and then a story before lights out worked like a charm.
goodnight125,After my mom tucked me into my bed, I always STAYED in bed.
goodnight125,My mom would go downstairs after putting my siblings and me to bed.
goodnight125,She’d clean up the kitchen, living room, and playroom, and then relax and watch tv.
goodnight125,Her favorite arm chair was pushed up against the living room wall only inches a way from the door way between the living room and kitchen.
goodnight125,She’d sit in her chair, enjoying her program, only to be interrupted from her leisure by the sound of children’s laughter coming from the kitchen.
goodnight125,“Go to bed,” she’d warn the mischievous children assuming it was my siblings and me, out of bed, and up to no good.
goodnight125,The laughter and patter of little feet running around the kitchen would continue.
goodnight125,My mom would scold “us” a couple of more times before she’d get up to force us to go back upstairs to bed.
goodnight125,As the children came into her peripheral vision, they’d vanish in thin air before she could approach them.
goodnight125,She could never quite tell about 2 of the children and their likeness to that of my sister and brother, but the third spectral was a dead ringer for me.
goodnight125,However, I can assure you that when my mom put me to bed at night, I stayed in bed.
goodnight125,I never got up.
goodnight125,I never went down stairs.
goodnight125,As I’ve mentioned in a previous story, those stairs terrified me.
goodnight125,I would never want to venture down them at night, in the dark.
goodnight125,When I was young, I had developed a bad habit of running off to my neighbors house to play with my best friend.
goodnight125,I was notorious for taking off, leaving without a grown up, or letting my parents know where I was going.
goodnight125,One day while my older siblings were at school, I was home alone with my mom.
goodnight125,I don’t remember much about that day.
goodnight125,I assume I was playing with legos or some other toy in my playroom.
goodnight125,My mom was busy cleaning the house.
goodnight125,At some point I slipped away and ran up the street to see if I could play with my friend.
goodnight125,My mom didn’t notice that yet again, I’d taken off.
goodnight125,She went down to the basement to use the washing machine and dryer we had stacked up on pallets down there.
goodnight125,As she loaded the washing machine facing the wall, she heard the giggling and laughter of a small child.
goodnight125,She assumed it to be me since I was the only one home with her.
goodnight125,She spoke to me with loving words of what a mom would usually say to a 3 or 4 year old child.
goodnight125,She felt my small arms wrap around her, hugging her.
goodnight125,Then with such force that no small child could possibly exude, “I” shoved her forward, causing her body to slam up against the washing machine.
goodnight125,She said she could hear me laughing and saw my backside as I ran into my father’s workshop, which was really just a hidden room in the basement.
goodnight125,At one point in the house’s history this room had been completely sealed off.
goodnight125,My mom ran up the stairs, slammed the door shut behind her, and dead bolted it shut.
goodnight125,She yelled through the closed door that I couldn’t come out until I said “sorry”.
goodnight125,For the next hour she heard me up on the basement stairs, behind the door, kicking at it, screaming my head off.
goodnight125,That’s when the phone rang.
goodnight125,Even as my neighbor had explained to my mom that I had been at her house for the past two hours and she just realized I didn’t tell my mom I’d taken off, my mom could still hear me screaming on the stairs.
goodnight125,What really spooked her was she could also hear me in the back round, at my neighbors house.
goodnight125,When my mom hung up the phone, she was chilled to the bone.
goodnight125,All at once the racket “I” was making stopped and the house was silent around her.
goodnight125,My mom is a very religious person.
goodnight125,After that day there was always a bottle of holy water on top of the washing machine.
goodnight125,I once asked my mom why it was there, hesitantly she told me this story.
goodnight125,I should pause right here to let you know that my mom was NOT the type of person to tell ghost stories or say anything about the house that might scare me.
goodnight125,If anything she totally played down any of the numerous scary encounters we experienced.
goodnight125,I didn’t even feel comfortable talking to my mom when something paranormal seeming went down.
goodnight125,During the time we lived in this house, my sister was the only one I’d confide it because she was the only one who didn’t use the “your imagination is running away with you” excuse.
goodnight125,When I was in 6th grade, I took a bus home from school everyday.
goodnight125,My older sister went to different school and she always came home before me.
goodnight125,Every school day was the same routine.
goodnight125,At 3:30 the bus would drop me off.
goodnight125,I’d run straight up stairs to use the bathroom (I never used the bathrooms at school if I could help it).
goodnight125,After I relieved myself, I’d go downstairs to get a snack and watch some tv.
goodnight125,One day, it seemed like any other, I ran off the bus, through the house, and up to the bathroom.
goodnight125,“Hi!
goodnight125,I’m home” I said to my sister as I passed by her room on the way to the bathroom.
goodnight125,I did my business and as I passed by her own my way back down stairs, I realized she looked very freaked out.
goodnight125,“What’s wrong?” I asked.
goodnight125,My sister explained to me that apparently, I had already came home from school.
goodnight125,I did what I always did... sort off.
goodnight125,She heard me come into the house through the back door.
goodnight125,She heard me run up the stairs.
goodnight125,She saw me pass by her room on my way to the bathroom.
goodnight125,She heard me go into the bathroom.
goodnight125,She even heard the toilet flush.
goodnight125,The only “off” thing was that when I was done, I went into my bedroom and shut the door instead of going back down stairs to watch tv, like I always do.
goodnight125,About 10 minutes later while I was “supposedly” went in my room, she heard the school bus stop outside our house.
goodnight125,She checked her watch.
goodnight125,It was 3:30, the usual time I made it home by.
goodnight125,She got really scared when she saw me from her window getting off the bus and walking up to the house.
goodnight125,She was positive I had already been home and was in my room.
goodnight125,My sister swears up and down it wasn’t a dream nor was it a case of deja-vu.
goodnight125,The thing is, I was really terrified of the 2nd floor of the house.
goodnight125,I only went upstairs to use the bathroom or when I had to be in my room for bed.
goodnight125,Never did I go in my room to do school work or hang out, unless I had a friend over.
goodnight125,I refused to even close the door to my room because being in the room with my door shut made me feel like I was in the room with something else.
goodnight125,As a kid, I tried to spend as little time as humanly possible away from the 2nd floor.
goodnight125,Years later I loved to read anything on paranormal activity... I stumbled upon doppelganger lore.
goodnight125,It seems to fit.
goodnight125,I’ve never seen my doppelganger, but my mom and sister have.
goodnight125,I wonder if an entity mimicked me or was it some glitch in time.
goodnight125,I guess I’ll never really know.
goodnight125,Oh and here’s the link to doppelganger info: http://manchesterparanormal.org/Doppelganger.php
goodnight125,Very interesting read

goodnight127,I am an empty cup and music is my drink.
goodnight127,I always have a tune stuck in my head.
goodnight127,Music is something that I am very passionate about.
goodnight127,I can find a song for every occasion.
goodnight127,So many memories of different chapters of my life play through my mind when I hear a specific song.
goodnight127,“Don’t want to miss a thing” by Aerosmith reminds me of my first true love.
goodnight127,“Glycerine” by Bush reminds me of my first serious boyfriend
goodnight127,“I saw the sign” by Ace of Base.
goodnight127,It’s the first CD I ever owned (You can stop laughing now.
goodnight127,We all make poor choices).
goodnight127,“Yesterday” by the Beatles calls to mind a time when I was brave.
goodnight127,I had to sing it by myself in front of the entire chorus to audition to sing it for a concert.
goodnight127,Yes, I was terrible.
goodnight127,No, I didn’t get the part.
goodnight127,I was the only person who volunteered to do it though.
goodnight127,No one raised a hand until after I sang my little heart out and revealed just how tone deaf I am.
goodnight127,After I finished, everyone else’s hands shot up.
goodnight127,“If Inanna can stand up there alone and sing like a dieing crow, so can I!”
goodnight127,“Under the bridge” by The Red Hot Chili Peppers.
goodnight127,I said my first “I love you” to The Man while we were listening to this song.
goodnight127,I snuck it with the lyrics.
goodnight127,He had already told me “I love you” the day before, but I held out until I was positive.
goodnight127,“Run Around” by Blue’s Travelers was playing on the radio when I went bungee jumping.
goodnight127,“I’m yours” by Jason Miraz was the song played at my best friend’s funeral
goodnight127,“Like a Prayer” by Madonna.
goodnight127,It’s the anthem of my childhood.
goodnight127,I’ll always remind warm summer nights, running around in my back yard, and the sweet smell of fresh cut grass.
goodnight127,“Hey You” by Pink Floyd.
goodnight127,My all time favorite song.
goodnight127,“Never Dreamed” by Black Label Society brings back the pain of when The Man and I broke up.
goodnight127,I’d listen to it over and over desperately hoping that it reflected his inner feelings.
goodnight127,“The Rain in Africa” by Toto.
goodnight127,Best inside joke EVER.
goodnight127,I could add a hundred more songs to the list, more of my favorites, ones I can’t stand.
goodnight127,There is a song for every occasion in my life.
goodnight127,I think this sums up most of the significant ones. 
goodnight127,

goodnight86,A few days ago The Man and I needed to go to the library the other day to fax some paper work.
goodnight86,While we were hanging out at the check out counter waiting to make sure everything went through one of our favorite librarians came over to chat.
goodnight86,During the conversation the librarian thanked The Man for his donation.
goodnight86,I had no clue what he was talking about.
goodnight86,When we left the library I asked The Man about it.
goodnight86,Sheepishly he told me that he gave them $25 on his last visit.
goodnight86,I couldn’t stop from grinning.
goodnight86,The Man selflessly gave and had made no mention of it.
goodnight86,He didn’t do it for acknowledgement.
goodnight86,He did it to help a worthy cause.
goodnight86,Then I thought about it.
goodnight86,The other day I was trying to open Google man’s in his phone.
goodnight86,I accidentally opened his FB messenger instead.
goodnight86,I saw a messenger from his friend’s little sister, again thanking him.
goodnight86,I asked him about it and it turns out he donated some money to her gofundme account so she can raise the funds to go to college.
goodnight86,He thought she’d put the assistance to good use.
goodnight86,I am with a man who is strong, smart, and kind.
goodnight86,He is giving.
goodnight86,He is helpful.
goodnight86,He does none of this for himself.
goodnight86,He does it to help others out there who need it.
goodnight86,I know he doesn’t do it for my approval, but my pride in him is through the roof.
goodnight86,It’s all these thousand and one things that spark and pop about him that make me grin ear to ear.
goodnight86,We’ve both been working a lot lately and I miss him, but I’m glad that he leaves me with such pleasant thoughts.
goodnight86,With him not only do I feel loved, but I know that I am loved.
goodnight86,

goodnight112,With Bobo at his grandparents house for the week end, it was up to The Man and I to entertain the girls.
goodnight112,I had wanted to get out and about today, hoping to hike up Table Rock.
goodnight112,I know bringing the girls for that level of a hike would only end up being a nightmare.
goodnight112,No biggy though.
goodnight112,We are semi new to this area and we, as a family, love to explore!
goodnight112,So I looked up some near by must-see destinations, was in awe of the beauty of yellow branch falls, plugged the address into my g.p.s.
goodnight112,and away we went.
goodnight112,Estimated arrival time was only 2 hours a way.
goodnight112,Perfect.
goodnight112,With car ride tunes and snacks we drove through the country.
goodnight112,The scenery was to die for!
goodnight112,We saw a zillion plantation style houses and farms.
goodnight112,I spotted every type of cow conceivable, donkeys, rabbits, chickens, horses, llamas, rabbits, dogs, cats, even a fox!
goodnight112,We rode up mountains.
goodnight112,I felt like I was lost among the clouds.
goodnight112,Turns out though I plugged the address of the state park and NOT the trail the waterfall was on.
goodnight112,We couldn’t find it, but we weren’t disappointed.
goodnight112,We saw quite a few waterfalls, creeks, streams, rapids.
goodnight112,Trees of all shapes and sizes surrounded us.
goodnight112,We drove through tight winding roads and I’d hold my breath.
goodnight112,The girls made me laugh so hard that tears slid down my cheeks.
goodnight112,Without meaning too, we drove in a huge loop through the mountain roads.
goodnight112,We passed by the trail for Yellow Branch Waterfall on our way back towards home (and more importantly dinner – we were starving!)
goodnight112,We parked and looked around, but the hike to the waterfall is about 3.5 miles.
goodnight112,We were too hungry for even that.
goodnight112,At least now I know where to go.
goodnight112,So be prepared.
goodnight112,I’m going back!
goodnight112,Another adventure for another day.
goodnight112,It’s not really about the destination, it’s the journey that you really remember   
goodnight112,
goodnight107,
goodnight107,I’m hopelessly addicted to the news.
goodnight107,For me it is important to know all about the world around me.
goodnight107,No topic is too bland.
goodnight107,I like to read through local news, national news, health, world news, science, politics.
goodnight107,No topic is off limits for my thirsty mind.
goodnight107,I like to keep current.
goodnight107,Keeping my head in the sand isn’t an option for me.
goodnight107,With my quest for knowledge comes a huge price.
goodnight107,Many news sites (and network stations (*cough* Fox) have lost their objective ways and subtly slip in their own opinion.
goodnight107,What happened to an unbiased delivery?
goodnight107,So for me to try to find the true story I need to work twice as hard.
goodnight107,First I read the major sites and then... the conspiracy theories.
goodnight107,I believe the truth lies some where in the middle.
goodnight107,Another devastating side effect caused from following too many real life news stories is all the loss, all the pain, all the tragedy.
goodnight107,ISIS, Taliban, and Syria are all too familiar to us.
goodnight107,It’s one thing to read a story about the terrorism, the civil war, the chemical warfare, migrants and refugees trying to flee, but it’s another thing to imagine myself as one of them.
goodnight107,Truly terrifying and heart breaking.
goodnight107,Why do we kill each other?!?!
goodnight107,Why?
goodnight107,We have mass shootings like the recent Kalamazoo rampage.
goodnight107,Can you imagine taking your son to buy his 1st New car when suddenly you are gunned down simply for being in the wrong place at the exact wrong time.
goodnight107,That’s not destiny!!!
goodnight107,It’s sickening and cruel.
goodnight107,What about the Flint water?
goodnight107,A whole town being poisoned by the very water they pay for to drink, bath in, do laundry, etc.
goodnight107,These poor people have led poisoning among other things.
goodnight107,Can you imagine not being able to get yourself a glass of water out of your kitchen sink?
goodnight107,Let me not forget to mention what this has done to the value of their homes and businesses.
goodnight107,This has been going on for the past 2 years.
goodnight107,It’s only been brought to light in the past 6 months.
goodnight107,Humanity has begun to lose its ways.
goodnight107,The senseless and selfishness of it all lashes fiercely against my soul.
goodnight107,So let’s make a change with the means we have available to us.
goodnight107,Let’s pass kindness on.
goodnight107,Open doors FOR EVERYONE, yes even the teenager.
goodnight107,Let’s take the time to say “hello” with a smile on our face.
goodnight107,Pay for the meal of the person behind you in line.
goodnight107,Let’s do good things for others so that maybe in the depths of their own personal sorrows, we can be the beam of light.
goodnight107, 
goodnight107,
goodnight115,
goodnight115,Oh my stars, my sweet Sam... I thought of you today.
goodnight115,It broke my heart as I poured through the “what it’s.” Sam, my sweet beautiful Sam.
goodnight115,What can I possibly say to you?
goodnight115,What is it that you need?
goodnight115,What is it that I can possibly give to you?
goodnight115,I swear to you this, my Sam.
goodnight115,I love you.
goodnight115,I always have and I always will.
goodnight115,You are mine.
goodnight115,I am yours.
goodnight115,My arms ache to hold you.
goodnight115,My eyes ache to see you.
goodnight115,Please my darling, please understand that I wish for a life you could have been a part of.
goodnight115,You were always wanted.
goodnight115,You were always loved.
goodnight115,I would have done everything to keep you.
goodnight115,Sam... I know the sacrifice you made.
goodnight115,It was her or you.
goodnight115,You chose her.
goodnight115,I cannot thank you enough.
goodnight115,Did you know?
goodnight115,So small and yet you knew the potential of the future?
goodnight115,Did you know that she understands?
goodnight115,She honors you.
goodnight115,She loves you too.
goodnight115,She knows you played your part through and through.
goodnight115,She sees you, Sam, even when I can not.
goodnight115,You look after her.
goodnight115,You watch her.
goodnight115,Why did you think she was more valuable than you?
goodnight115,Sam, do you see the price of your sacrifice and does it give you pride?
goodnight115,My fate, her fate, your fate, I see it all twisted together.
goodnight115,Sam, what can I give you that is just yours?
goodnight115,I know that you’ve never had it fair nor easy.
goodnight115,Sam-I-am, my precious boy, you are a prince amongst princes.
goodnight115,I would trade my life for yours.
goodnight115,I love you forever and always.
goodnight115,How can I show you that even though I never got the chance to hold you that you are indeed in my arms, in my heart, and amongst the stars above my head.
goodnight115,Whether you are physical or not, you are mine Sam.
goodnight115,I love you.
goodnight115,I miss you.
goodnight115,You are precious.
goodnight115,Most of all, I am sorry.
goodnight115,Some how, I failed you.
goodnight115,I can not let it go.
goodnight115,I would trade my life for a single minute with you.
goodnight115,I would kiss you on the cheek and again, in between your eyes.
goodnight115,My arms would hold you close.
goodnight115,Tears would roll down my cheeks.
goodnight115,Please, oh please remember my sweet boy, you are gone, but never forgotten. 
goodnight115,
goodnight88,
goodnight88,My shoulders ache and hunch forward.
goodnight88,My eyes blur and through the lenses everything seems hazy and blurry.
goodnight88,Pulses beat timidly through the bottoms of my feet.
goodnight88,My skin is practically screaming.
goodnight88,I am so very, very physically tired.
goodnight88,Work has taken a lot out of me this week and the torture sessions are no where near over.
goodnight88,I don’t know what’s worse when my body steps into methodical mode or when my brain checks out rendering me an imbecile.
goodnight88,It’s brutal and defeating.
goodnight88,I am scheduled for a 6 hour shift tomorrow and *sigh* that’s my short day.
goodnight88,Usually I’m endless energy and perky to a fault.
goodnight88,Seems I’ve used it all up today.
goodnight88,Faking being sincere isn’t as easy as it once was.
goodnight88,Tomorrow will be an gorgeous day and I’ll be locked in my cage facing fierce scrutiny and feeling like a failure under it all.
goodnight88,Maybe I’ll feel better after I sleep.
goodnight88,Hard to close my eyes when my brain is spinning.
goodnight88,
goodnight144,
goodnight144,I’ve been growing aware of it since I’ve settled into the south and my new house.
goodnight144,I never dreamed something so petty would irk me so much... but I’m skinny with a gut.
goodnight144,Not working and consuming way too much junk food is really taking its toll on my body.
goodnight144,So now that I’ve identified the problem, I can either correct it or start buying bigger pants.
goodnight144,To be honest, I don’t want to accept this as the new me.
goodnight144,New Years seems like a good time to lay down a resolution.
goodnight144,After January 1st, I think it’s time to say good bye to soda and the rest of junk food I so love.
goodnight144,I’d also like to work out a bit more.
goodnight144,
goodnight141,
goodnight141,Oh where, oh where do I start?
goodnight141,It hasn’t been a particularly busy or interesting week, but my goal is to stay current with my life... even if it’s basic by ALL standards.
goodnight141,The most worthy event was Deedee’s birthday.
goodnight141,We bestowed upon her monster, cosmic brownies, a phone card, and some make up.
goodnight141,Nothing major except she’s 14 and in four years she will be a young adult.
goodnight141,Holy cow.
goodnight141,Revelations like this make me want to freeze time.
goodnight141,Her big ticket item scored will be tickets to Warp Tour, but since that doesn’t take place until March, I’ve no choice but to give it belated.
goodnight141,Bobo got sent home with a notice from the school nurse.
goodnight141,They’re suggesting he has a astigmatism and there for will need corrective eye wear.
goodnight141,I’m shocked Bobo will be my first spawn to wear glasses, but I’m not surprised by the suspected diagnosis.
goodnight141,Like mother like son.
goodnight141,Is it wrong that I think he’ll like great with four eyes?!?!
goodnight141,I’m looking forward to his eye exam.
goodnight141,Even though I secretly can’t wait to see him sporting glasses, I am concerned about him losing them or breaking them in the future.
goodnight141,This is Bobo we’re talking about after all.
goodnight141,Nothing big on the Snoochie front other than I showed her how to make dream catchers so she is spending her day off from school crafting away.
goodnight141,Took the man out to El Pablano on Saturday night.
goodnight141,I got a big ol’ margarita and the tres amigos (steak, chicken and shrimp grilled to perfection served over pineapple and covered in some sort of yummy white cheese).
goodnight141,I never thought I’d love Mexican food so much... but yeah, I do.
goodnight141,It’s amazeballs.
goodnight141,Date night was a five star event although The Man’s been under the weather for a week now so I’m sure that made the night slightly less enjoyable for him.
goodnight141,I hope he perks up soon.
goodnight141,I cheated on my no soda diet, but it was a small cheat.
goodnight141,I got Code Red, just ONE 2 liter and to be completely honest I don’t regret it.
goodnight141,This doesn’t mean I’m going back to my old ways... it just means I indulged.
goodnight141,Cranky boss hasn’t been too cranky and work has been pretty good over all.
goodnight141,I really can’t complain about my employment.
goodnight141,I like spending my pay checks.
goodnight141,With that, I think I’ve summed my week up except for maybe this: Who steals chairs from a restaurant... seriously....
goodnight141,Lmfao!
goodnight141,
goodnight91,
goodnight91,Note: So this particular entry is inevitably going to be quite long.
goodnight91,It’s a story I’ve been working on.
goodnight91,I will not be posting sections of it in different entries.
goodnight91,The entire story will be posted all in this specific blog.
goodnight91,So if you choose to follow along this is the only place you’ll find it.
goodnight91,Feel free to leave comments and critics for me to review.
goodnight91,I rarely finish my stories so perhaps feedback will help get me in gear to complete this one.
goodnight91,Hopefully you like it although I’ll be the first to admit, it may not be for everyone.
goodnight91,*******************************************************************
goodnight91,Chapter 1.
goodnight91,The vast, wild jungle forest rose up from nowhere, standing mightily next to the barren, scorched desert.
goodnight91,The edges of the dusty sand were naturally guarded by tall, lush, vividly green trees and brush.
goodnight91,Members of a remote, secret tribe hid among the canopy and down below in the thorny tangles of shrubbery.
goodnight91,For hundreds of years it had been their sacred duty to keep watch on all of the entrances to the jungle, protecting the ancient race of humanoid creatures that lived within.
goodnight91,It was a particularly important time to be vigilant.
goodnight91,The Queen was ripe and could birth at any given moment.
goodnight91,This would be her second known offspring.
goodnight91,She had already bore a son, but it was known that he would not be entitled to inherit the powerful, but modest kingdom.
goodnight91,In this strange land it was the female of the species who reigned supreme.
goodnight91,While the males of this mysterious race, the Lilim, were almost always physically stronger, their psychic powers tended to be inferior than that of their female counterparts.
goodnight91,The females exuded more patience, wisdom, cunning minds despite ruling with vicious iron fists when necessary.
goodnight91,Ages upon ages ago in a time forgotten to most, the ruling Queen had made a pact with the natives of the jungle.
goodnight91,In exchange for the villagers labor, protection, and dedication to the strange, beautiful, angelic-like race the natives flourished.
goodnight91,There was no more sickness nor hunger.
goodnight91,The Lilim showed a great respect to the villagers.
goodnight91,It was considered a serious crime to take advantage of any of them.
goodnight91,The Queen had insisted the relationship must always be in balance.
goodnight91,The humans prospered under the rule and guidance of this strange race.
goodnight91,Esi hid high in the canopy of the trees.
goodnight91,He gazed far out into the blindingly bright, barren desert.
goodnight91,It was his assignment to guard the entrances leading into the jungle.
goodnight91,He had much help with this important task, but rarely did anything give him the need to actually rise to action.
goodnight91,No battles with foreign enemies to protect the Lilim or his own people.
goodnight91,The desert, the jungle, and thus the kingdom hid in a remote corner of the Earth where outsiders seldom wandered.
goodnight91,The young guardian knew he should stay focused and alert, but the anticipation and excitement of the upcoming birth proved to be a great distraction.
goodnight91,Desperately he wanted to see the infant.
goodnight91,The first time the Queen had given birth had been extremely disappointing although Ex I would never admit it.
goodnight91,It had been less than a decade ago since the fateful day Prince Bael had entered this world.
goodnight91,Several hours after the announcement of his birth villagers and Lilim alike crowded together in the court yards below the golden temple eagerly awaiting the High Priestess, Cecelia to present the infant for all to behold and revere.
goodnight91,Esi, a child then, did not have to work or stand guard that day.
goodnight91,He was among those in attendance for the ceremony.
goodnight91,He remembered the sights and sounds with vivid clarity.
goodnight91,The Queen, who never aged a single day, ascended the temple stairs at a slow, steady pace.
goodnight91,Her long violet dress robes fluttered and danced in the breeze.
goodnight91,She carried a swaddled bundle tightly in her arms.
goodnight91,Her creamy, pale skin looked like marble, except for her cheeks which glowed with more color to them than usual.
goodnight91,Following behind Queen Lilith walked the High Priestess, who maintained a precise distance of three steps back.
goodnight91,When the two women reached the ceremonial day on top of the temple, the Queen turned to face Cecelia and placed the small bundle into her arms.
goodnight91,
goodnight100,
goodnight100,I will not cave.
goodnight100,I will not relent.
goodnight100,I will not bow down.
goodnight100,My will is stronger than many other forces on this Earth.
goodnight100,It’s time for me to channel it and prove to myself that I have what it takes.
goodnight100,Today was day three in my new routine.
goodnight100,I woke up sore and stiff from yesterday’s work.
goodnight100,I dealt with the pain by enjoying a hot cup of good coffee, a steamy shower, and 2 Aleve.
goodnight100,I eased my way slowly into my work out.
goodnight100,Yoga was a perfect start.
goodnight100,Next I did some steps.
goodnight100,I have terrible rhythm, but steps are my favorite part of the routine.
goodnight100,Jogging followed next, then alternating lunges.
goodnight100,It’s a little breezy outside and the air is crisp and slightly cold.
goodnight100,The Man and I went for a short walk.
goodnight100,When we got back home I did two dance routines.
goodnight100,Total work out time is probably around 45 minutes to an hour.
goodnight100,I’m debating adding on 15 – 20 minutes before dinner.
goodnight100,My legs really ache.
goodnight100,I’m positive if I continue and work through the pain that I will grow accustomed to it.
goodnight100,Fluid movement will happen once more.
goodnight100,We have too much junk food in this house.
goodnight100,Next time I go grocery shopping I need to skip the snack section and hang out with the fruits and veggies.
goodnight100,I wish I had my bike still.
goodnight100,I love cycling.
goodnight100,It’s low impact on my knees and yet it’s a highly effective work out.
goodnight100,I’m adding a new bike to my wish list.
goodnight100,I deserve it after all.
goodnight100,Not too mention on nice days I can bike to work.
goodnight100,That’d be useful on days when I’m too busy for a longer work out.
goodnight100,I don’t know why people bother with treadmills.
goodnight100,They’re expensive and you can just as easily walk around outside.
goodnight100,Sunshine is a natural antidepressant and it’s free.
goodnight100,I really don’t see a point in wasting my hard earned money on a gym membership when I can creatively come up with a work out that’s just as effective.
goodnight100,This weekend I’ll be at work for most of it.
goodnight100,Unfortunate the brunt of my weekly hours have been allotted for Saturday and Sunday.
goodnight100,No time for hiking.
goodnight100,When my schedule clears up I’ll have to plan a hike for The Man and me.
goodnight100,He’s been getting the hiking bug too.
goodnight100,Can I just say one more time how awesome it is that my partner and I have so many things we are both interested in.
goodnight100,
goodnight114,
goodnight114,It’s chilly outside today.
goodnight114,Right now at this very moment, I’m in my bed all snug and cozy.
goodnight114,The whistle from a train cries out in the distance.
goodnight114,I’m a little surprised by how much the temperature dropped since yesterday.
goodnight114,I can feel spring inching closer and closer.
goodnight114,It’s just around the corner and I simply can not wait.
goodnight114,Our house may be tiny, too many people packed in tight cramp quarters, but our back yard is quite big.
goodnight114,Spindly trees stretch up in the middle while large bushes guard the parameter.
goodnight114,The yard itself could use a good raking, lots of leaves cling to the Earth.
goodnight114,I’ve meant to spend more time back there, but it’s been such a busy year.
goodnight114,My plan is to make the backyard my sanctuary.
goodnight114,I’ve started buzzing in the man’s ear about digging a fire pit.
goodnight114,So I need to add a rake and shovel to my ever growing wish list.
goodnight114,I’d love to buy a stone bench and set up an alter... but my privacy from the neighbors is compromised.
goodnight114,There are a few gaps in the bushes and I can catch glimpses of the apartment complex that’s on the street behind us.
goodnight114,On sunny days I can hear the loud laughter of my neighbors and well I wouldn’t want them to get the wrong idea.
goodnight114,The approach of warm weather is coming quick.
goodnight114,Some little white flowers that remind me of bells have already started to bloom.
goodnight114,They remind me that I am miserably failing my diet.
goodnight114,Seriously.
goodnight114,I had a deep dish pepperoni pizza with a bacon stuffed crust today for lunch.
goodnight114,It was delicious.
goodnight114,Food is finally getting the best of me.
goodnight114,I have these visions of me in cute sun dresses and my hair down.
goodnight114,Basically what I want is the exact opposite of my nature.
goodnight114,I love jeans, tee shirts, and hoodie sweatshirts.
goodnight114,I have the fashion sense of a 13 year old boy.
goodnight114,I NEED to lose this stupid gut and accumulate a wardrobe worthy of the lil’ goddess I am.
goodnight114,Masquerading around as a bummy teenager has gone on for far too long.
goodnight114,What else is going on these days... Deedee went on her S.T.E.M.
goodnight114,field trip today.
goodnight114,She had a great time and for once school wasn’t “boring”.
goodnight114,She has a field trip to your some colleges coming up next month.
goodnight114,She ate way too much sugar today and was play fighting with Snoochie.
goodnight114,Speaking of Snoochie, she is running for student body government next year.
goodnight114,She’ll be in 6th grade.
goodnight114,I hate how fast time is going.
goodnight114,She also brought home a brochure for band.
goodnight114,She wants to join.
goodnight114,I’m excited.
goodnight114,I’m hoping she’ll play the clarinet like the man and I.
goodnight114,Certainly would be easier for us to offer her assistance if she picks an instrument we both have experience with.
goodnight114,Bobo is Bobo and doesn’t have too much going on other than the fact that I need to buzz his head soon.
goodnight114,I’m planning on getting him a paint ball gun.
goodnight114,I think he will love it!!!
goodnight114,Recently spring cleaned the house and I’m happy with how orderly everything is.
goodnight114,I gave Jake and Andy bathes today.
goodnight114,Those boys are so cute covered in suds!
goodnight114,I think I’m finally winning the battle of the fleas.
goodnight114,The war was long, but I will prevail.
goodnight114,I guess that sums up everything going on around here.
goodnight114,If it’s warm tomorrow I think I’ll go for a run.
goodnight114,
goodnight149,
goodnight149,Toothless, as usual, spent much of the day in her corner near my bed.
goodnight149,I hate seeing her a shell of her former self.
goodnight149,I’m hoping with lots of TLC and her medications she can pull through this.
goodnight149,Deedee and I brought her outside for a lil’ mandatory exercise and change of scenery.
goodnight149,Toothless’s body posture appeared to have improved some what, maybe I am just being hopeful.
goodnight149,Tonight Andy was especially playful.
goodnight149,He really wanted to make friends with Toothless.
goodnight149,He got on his back and wiggled up to Toothless.
goodnight149,She whipped her tail at him.
goodnight149,He thought it was invitation to play.
goodnight149,It wasn’t.
goodnight149,It was a warning he over looked.
goodnight149,Toothless reached out, hissed, and sunk her claws into poor Andy’s paw.
goodnight149,He’s okay, but she did get him really good.
goodnight149,Luckily Andy is such a lovey boy, I know this squirmish won’t get him down.
goodnight149,
goodnight146,
goodnight146,I really don’t have that much to say tonight, I think.
goodnight146,Work seems to be getting better.
goodnight146,Sure, it’ll have it’s ups and downs, but that’s just how life goes.
goodnight146,No such thing as a perfect barrel of apples, right?
goodnight146,All in all, I like it.
goodnight146,I will adjust.
goodnight146,I will adapt.
goodnight146,I will strive to succeed.
goodnight146,The soda free year is still in gear.
goodnight146,I can’t believe I’m passing up soda.
goodnight146,I’m positive such a small (and yet huge to me) change will really benefit me in the long run.
goodnight146,No more am I guzzling caffeinated, artificially colored, fizzy, liquid sugar.
goodnight146,Now would be a good time to mention that not only am I slimming down my waist line, but I’m improving my skin.
goodnight146,Once no soda becomes the no thought involved norm for me, I should figure out the next bad habit to give up... baby steps.
goodnight146,My diet has been more nutritionally substantial too.
goodnight146,Today’s lunch was spring mix, baby kale, onions, apples with balsamic vinaigrette drizzled on top.
goodnight146,Dinner was spaghetti, but the pasta was whole wheat.
goodnight146,My baby has really been supportive in all of this, although he keeps making it a point to say he enjoys the new curves.
goodnight146,On a side note, the kids go back to school tomorrow.
goodnight146,They are less than thrilled.
goodnight146,
goodnight130,
goodnight130,Hi there!
goodnight130,Can you answer a quick question for me?
goodnight130,Just use the first thought that comes to mind and please don’t Google it.
goodnight130,Here’s the question: What color is the opposite of red?
goodnight130,So simply I know and yet, it was the meat and potatoes of a serious debate at my house tonight.
goodnight130,My husband thinks it’s one color and I think it’s a different one.
goodnight130,I’m curious as to who’s answer is the more popular choice.
goodnight130,I won’t say who said what though (maybe you’d be bias if you had prior knowledge of our answers)
goodnight130,Thanks for your help in this 
goodnight130,
goodnight89,
goodnight89,Today was a beautiful day.
goodnight89,I know technically it is winter, but it feels and smells like spring.
goodnight89,The sky today was such a bright, light blue with billowy clouds stretched out as far as the eye could see.
goodnight89,The Man and I went out some place new (to us) for breakfast.
goodnight89,While the scenery was great, I wasn’t impressed with the food nor the service.
goodnight89,Very ordinary and cold.
goodnight89,I’ll take the sweethearts down at Waffle House anytime over stiff service.
goodnight89,After our weekly breakfast date we went to the Auto Store.
goodnight89,I got a deco- air freshener (skull dog tags), steering wheel cover (also skulls), and a new knob for the Stang’s gear shift (a skull... shocking).
goodnight89,We also got all the goodies to regularly clean and detail both of our cars.
goodnight89,I’m off of work tonight.
goodnight89,Nice to spend the evening with my babies.
goodnight89,Deedee showed off her culinary skills and cooked us spaghetti.
goodnight89,Now we have already watched a movie and the kids are getting their evening chores done before bedtime.
goodnight89,Snoochie is washing the dinner dishes.
goodnight89,Bobo is cleaning the cat box.
goodnight89,I tend not to give them money straight out for their chores.
goodnight89,I pay about $3 a week if they do the bare minimum (1 daily chore through out the week).
goodnight89,If they do any extra work I add a dollar here, a dollar there.
goodnight89,They have the option of going to Family Dollar and spending their money or they can save up.
goodnight89,Recently Snoochie got a dragon Lego set with her allowance and Bobo got a new video game.
goodnight89,As a kid, I can not remember a time when I was exempt from chores (except when I was physically injured or sick).
goodnight89,My mom had some grade “A” expectations too.
goodnight89,I had to brush 50 hair balls off of our dog.
goodnight89,Vacuum the living room.
goodnight89,Dust ALL the wood in the living room (and there was so much wood).
goodnight89,Of course I had to clean the playroom and my bedroom (those were my wrecking grounds anyway).
goodnight89,I had to help wash and fold laundry.
goodnight89,Clean, set, and clear the kitchen table.
goodnight89,Shovel the driveway and side walks on snowy days.
goodnight89,Rake the front, back, and two side yards when the autumn leaves fell, and mow the grass in the spring.
goodnight89,The more I think back, the more I can keep adding to this list.
goodnight89,When I was tiny my mom paid cut throat rates.
goodnight89,I got like 25 cents and a “Be lucky you got that.
goodnight89,I can make you do the chores for free if you complain.” She did get competitive with her rates though.
goodnight89,I remember loving Sunday’s because I’d get $5 if my chores were done on time.
goodnight89,After my parents separated my mom was incredibly busy between work and school.
goodnight89,She couldn’t stand a messy house, but wasn’t around to make sure it was cleaned and maintained.
goodnight89,That’s when I hit it big time.
goodnight89,That’s right ladies and gentlemen, at 14 years old I got a $25’s a week for helping my mom out.
goodnight89,If I had been a better kid, more altruistic, more sensitive, I would have refused the amount.
goodnight89,I didn’t though.
goodnight89,Unfortunately I was an insensitive kid.
goodnight89,I pocketed that money and loved every second of it.
goodnight89,My heft allowance got even more weighty.
goodnight89,My brother and sister also made a whopping $25 a week, but when they got real jobs they refused to help out.
goodnight89,My mom told me if I did their chores too, I could have their allowance.
goodnight89,I was pulling in $75 a week just by really thoroughly cleaning my house.
goodnight89,So when it comes to my kids, I feel weird burdening them with too many chores.
goodnight89,They each have a daily chore and then a few extra ones (like changing the trash, bringing in groceries).
goodnight89,I think we’ve got a good system.
goodnight89,
goodnight99,
goodnight99,(On a side note I have to work all night so this journal entry is a bit on the early side.
goodnight99,I know it looks like this is the second blog of the day, but it’s not since this website’s time is not in correlation with the time zone I live in).
goodnight99,Gluttony is another one of the 7 deadly sins.
goodnight99,It signifies over indulgence, lack of self righteousness and is often symbolized by a pig.
goodnight99,In the past gluttony played a role in my life.
goodnight99,It’s not that I always over eat... it’s that I’ve had past addictions that separated me from reality.
goodnight99,I over indulged to numb life and slip away from reality.
goodnight99,It took its toll on me as I didn’t give attention to the areas in my life that needed it most.
goodnight99,My past experience with gluttony is that during my pursuit to numb my mind I was withholding my attention to the areas of my life that needed it most.
goodnight99,These days gluttony and over indulgence doesn’t really play a part in my life.
goodnight99,I don’t drink nor do drugs.
goodnight99,I really over eat.
goodnight99,Most meals I can’t finish and end up sharing my left overs with Bobo or The Man.
goodnight99,If necessary I can go a couple of days without eating if that means ensuring every one else does get to eat (this situation isn’t applicable now, but it was during the darker days).
goodnight99,So my analysis from self examination is that gluttony is not one of the seven deadly sins that I am guilty of.
goodnight99,I’ll be ranking them as I write.
goodnight99,So here’s the list (1 being the sin I am most guilty of, 7 the least).
goodnight99,Vanity
goodnight99,Gluttony
goodnight99,
goodnight99,For next blog, I’ll discuss Sloth
goodnight99,
goodnight119,
goodnight119,Before I dive into the nitty gritty of this blog, I have a few things I want to say so you are very clear on how I feel.
goodnight119,The most important thing to note is that this entry is a rant, my opinion on RELIGION.
goodnight119,I will not try to talk you out of your beliefs nor will I debate mine.
goodnight119,Spirituality is a personal journey and whatever your beliefs might be, I respect that.
goodnight119,By no means ever will I cast judgement on a person based on what God they follow.
goodnight119,I am a human, like you.
goodnight119,It is not my place.
goodnight119,I guess that sums that up.
goodnight119,Onwards...
goodnight119,I was brought up in a strict Roman Catholic household.
goodnight119,We were in the pews every Sunday Mass.
goodnight119,We abstained from eating meat for lent.
goodnight119,I was baptized in the church.
goodnight119,I gave the readings at my first communion.
goodnight119,I went to confession and if I had nothing to confess, well I made stuff up.
goodnight119,I prayed to the Lord Almighty, Heavenly Father, Jesus, and of course holy Mary.
goodnight119,After I was confirmed, I never went to church again.
goodnight119,I never found comfort in my religion.
goodnight119,I had so many questions that were never wanted, approved of, or answered.
goodnight119,As a young adult I began to research as many religions as I could.
goodnight119,In the end, I’ve found my answers, my comfort, my source of balance.
goodnight119,Without taking you by the ankles and dragging you down the rabbit hole with me, I’ll say this: I’m pagan.
goodnight119,I believe in many gods and goddesses.
goodnight119,I do not “worship” them.
goodnight119,Instead my devotion is to the Earth.
goodnight119,I believe in ghosts, spirits, negative entities, and reincarnation.
goodnight119,I do not believe in a heaven nor hell.
goodnight119,I do believe that I have a moral obligation however and conduct myself appropriately.
goodnight119,I strongly do not believe that the bible is the word of god.
goodnight119,I do not believe a group of men have the right to cherry pick how I should live my life.
goodnight119,I hope I didn’t offend any of my readers.
goodnight119,If it works for you fantastic.
goodnight119,I however have many issues with Christianity and the bible.
goodnight119,I do not have issues with people who follow this faith however.
goodnight119,I respect you as a person and the beliefs you hold dear.
goodnight119,Me, categorizing myself as Pagan DOES not mean I pray to a false god or the devil.
goodnight119,I can not make my children learn a religion that I do not whole heartedly believe in.
goodnight119,For this reason they are  not baptised.
goodnight119,If they show an interest in a particular religion I encourage them to exam it.
goodnight119,I will never be the one to hold back faith.
goodnight119,Now having said all that (and feel free to ask any questions)... here is the rant.
goodnight119,Today it happened.
goodnight119,Deedee (who is Wiccan) came home from school and said that her teacher called Wiccan’s devil worshippers.
goodnight119,I was floored.
goodnight119,I was so tempted to call the school and give them the wrath of an angry mama lion.
goodnight119,Before I could give in to my anger, I knew I needed to calm down and objectify the situation.
goodnight119,I live in the bible belt.
goodnight119,How I choose to proceed with this could affect all 3 of my children for the rest of their public school career.
goodnight119,After asking a few co workers if any of the town’s high school teachers preached Christianity in the classroom, I learned that some do.
goodnight119,I can not blame someone for their commitment of their faith, but it angers me when they harshly judge something they hardly know anything about and misrepresent the facts – and to children no less.
goodnight119,My options here are limited.
goodnight119,If I make a big to do about this, I could be perceived as attacking a teacher who other than this is a really great teacher.
goodnight119,I won’t be in the middle of this feud.
goodnight119,My kids will be and they don’t want that.
goodnight119,They know fact from opinion.
goodnight119,I can use these incidents as lessons in tolerance instead.
goodnight119,I could pull them out of school or switch schools, but that won’t end things.
goodnight119,I need to make the best out of these difficult moments and demanding that religion be left out of school just isn’t going to fly here.
goodnight119,I’m in a rock and a hard place.
goodnight119,I’ve talked in depth with Deedee about it and she doesn’t want me to make a big to do out of it.
goodnight119,I know Deedee doesn’t worship the devil and Deedee knows it.
goodnight119,That should be what really matters.
goodnight119,The irony is that said teacher doesn’t know Deedee is Wiccan and constantly praises Deedee for being such a good student (who doesn’t get in trouble, who always completes assignments, studies for tests, and doesn’t talk out of turn).
goodnight119,This is one of those times I need to let it be, but for Deedee I’m wounded.
goodnight119, 
goodnight119,
goodnight84,
goodnight84,Ever since I was a child the “7 deadly sins” held my interest.
goodnight84,What I thought was intriguing is that they were never listed among the 10 commandments.
goodnight84,Although when exploring each deadly sin in depth it is easy to see how engaging in this behavior can lead to an immoral character.
goodnight84,I will write about each sin and how they affect my life.
goodnight84,I am starting with pride / vanity as currently I can see parallels between this sin and my view of myself.
goodnight84,Pride / Vanity is said to be the most vile, the most deadly sin out of the 7.
goodnight84,A perfect example of this sin is a self absorbed narcissist who demands constant validation and acceptance from others.
goodnight84,They seek compliments  and put themselves above others.
goodnight84,This is a form of self idolatry.
goodnight84,I think I can be a vain person when it comes to how demanding I am with how I look.
goodnight84,I obsess over my hair.
goodnight84,It’s always perfect.
goodnight84,I insist upon it.
goodnight84,I love make up.
goodnight84,I have quite a few dresser drawers devoted to my lotions, my lip sticks, eye pencils, hair brush, etc.
goodnight84,I don’t leave the house with out my tribal make up and my hair styled impeccably.
goodnight84,Certain nights of the week I sleep with a mixture of coconut oil and aragon oil massaged into my hair.
goodnight84,I wear a shower cap to protect my pillow cases.
goodnight84,15 minutes before I take a shower I lather honey all over my entire face and let it sit until I bath.
goodnight84,In my younger days (and I’m so sorry for my arrogance) I have actually had the nerve to say “If I ever get fat just shoot me” ... on multiple occasions.
goodnight84,How insensitive could I have been!
goodnight84,Karma has kicked in and now I have a pot belly.
goodnight84,So what do I do?
goodnight84,I’ve been fixated on dieting and exercising.
goodnight84,Could it be that I’m vain?
goodnight84,Humility is the opposite of vanity / pride.
goodnight84,I love to make other people feel good.
goodnight84,I love to give sincere, gooey, heartfelt compliments.
goodnight84,I place the value of myself above no one.
goodnight84,We as people are ALL equal.
goodnight84,I leave judgement up to higher powers.
goodnight84,I can be quite modest.
goodnight84,Although I am highly indulgent in a consuming grooming routine, if you were to compliment me I would shyly say thank you and blush.
goodnight84,I don’t like people gushing over me.
goodnight84,I give respect to those who have earned it and I give credit it where it is properly do.
goodnight84,So am vain?
goodnight84,Is there another sin I’m in deep with?
goodnight84,Next blog will be about gluttony.
goodnight84,

goodnight104,
goodnight104,When The Man was a child his older brother got hit by a truck and tragically died.
goodnight104,The catastrophic event has forever haunted his family since.
goodnight104,I’m sorry, but I can’t go into private details that surround this unfortunate accident.
goodnight104,I wasn’t there, didn’t know the family back then, and I certainly didn’t know the boy.
goodnight104,While dating The Man our relationship grew ever more serious.
goodnight104,He met my family.
goodnight104,I met his.
goodnight104,He saw all my old family photos.
goodnight104,I saw his.
goodnight104,I told him all about the skeletons in my closet.
goodnight104,He dug up his old bones in turn for me.
goodnight104,So I learned in confidence all about *B* (The Man’s brother) and his untimely demise and how effected it left The Man ever after.
goodnight104,We had our first child, Deedee.
goodnight104,Life was great, but it became very clear to us that Deedee is a highly gifted child.
goodnight104,She grew too big too quick.
goodnight104,We knew we wanted a family with several kids so when Deedee was a month shy of 2, BoBo came into this world right on cue.
goodnight104,Bobo’s first moments outside of me were almost his last.
goodnight104,It was a complicated delivery and to this day, Bobo still deals with obstacles created by those first crucial hours.
goodnight104,Life with Bobo was chaotic, hectic, and tense.
goodnight104,He screamed and wailed for hours upon hours.
goodnight104,I knew he hurt and yet I couldn’t soothe him.
goodnight104,I felt like I was failing my infant son.
goodnight104,As he grew we did what most parents do, we documented his growth with picture after picture.
goodnight104,It was great memere who brought it to my attention at first.
goodnight104,BoBo acts and looks just like his dead uncle.
goodnight104,When pictures of the boys were put next to each other even I could not always tell which child was my beloved son.
goodnight104,Soon all the grandparents and extended family members were commenting how astonished they were by the extreme similarities.
goodnight104,“Well they should look alike”, I thought.
goodnight104,“They are from  the same bloodline”.
goodnight104,Bobo frequently had nightmares and night terrors.
goodnight104,He’d scream in his sleep as if his limbs were being torn from his body.
goodnight104,He’d choke on his tears and shriek at the top of his tiny lungs.
goodnight104,It was horrendous watching him go through this.
goodnight104,When he was around 3 years old, I was finally able to ask him about his nightmares.
goodnight104,What he told me shocked me.
goodnight104,He told me he was riding a toy down the street (a scooter, we were later able to identify it, but at 3 Bobo didn’t know what a scooter was).
goodnight104,He rode the toy down a hill when suddenly a big truck hit him and he died.
goodnight104,Again, I shall not go into graphic details, but Bobo accurately described how his uncle died... only thing was Bobo didn’t know anything about *B* and especially not his death.
goodnight104,One day I was driving through a town near where we lived.
goodnight104,I drove by a cemetery.
goodnight104,Bobo informed me as the car past by the headstones “that’s where my body is”.
goodnight104,I found out years later that the cemetery I had passed was the one *B* was buried in.
goodnight104,One day when Bobo was a toddler and my third child had just been born, we went to a picnic at a nature persevere.
goodnight104,It was a huge friend and family type event.
goodnight104,I sat at a table feeding my newborn baby (Snoochie) next to *J* (The Man’s cousin).
goodnight104,A lady I didn’t know sat down next to me (hoping to get to see the little cherub cradled in my arms).
goodnight104,She looked out at a field where The Man was playing kick ball with Deedee, Bobo, and a few other kids.
goodnight104,I watched as her face grew white and she clutched *J*’s arm.
goodnight104,“J” She gasped.
goodnight104,“Look at that little boy.” She pointed right at Bobo.
goodnight104,“I’m seeing a ghost, J. That’s little *B* + last name.
goodnight104,He’s dead though.
goodnight104,Do you see him?
goodnight104,There’s a ghost out there with those kids!” She was clearly shocked and freaked out.
goodnight104,I didn’t know who she was though.
goodnight104,Turns out she was a neighbor from when The Man and *B* were children.
goodnight104,J turned calmly to the lady and said.
goodnight104,“That’s no ghost.
goodnight104,That’s Bobo + last name, *B*’s nephew.
goodnight104,Look over there” he exclaimed pointing at The Man.
goodnight104,“That’s his dad, The Man”.
goodnight104,The lady had no clue I was Bobo’s mom.
goodnight104,I watched her relax and finally understand that she wasn’t seeing a ghost at all, just some very dominant DNA.
goodnight104,Some times Bobo knows things he shouldn’t.
goodnight104,Things about *B*.
goodnight104,Things there is no possible way he could know.
goodnight104,I’ve got to wonder if *B* was sent back for another chance at life.
goodnight104,A lot of the family finds it unsettling how uncanny the resemblance is between the two boys, but The Man doesn’t care.
goodnight104,He loves his brother even through the barrier of death and he loves the son he has now.
goodnight104,
goodnight138,
goodnight138,Dear Pb,
goodnight138,I miss you.
goodnight138,Remember all of the silly names I had for you, my bunny bumpkins.
goodnight138,I want you to know that I loved you dearly.
goodnight138,Memories of your buggy brown eyes will forever put a smile on my face.
goodnight138,I love the way you grunted and honked at the vacuum.
goodnight138,Your silly rabbit antics were endless.
goodnight138,I hated washing dishes, but to look down and see you at my feet made those darn dishes bare able.
goodnight138,Some people have teddy bears.
goodnight138,When I watched tv in bed I had you.
goodnight138,I’m sorry I couldn’t take you with me.
goodnight138,I wish with all my heart that I could brought you with us.
goodnight138,I feared such a huge move would have killed you.
goodnight138,Pb, you are a cure for the blues.
goodnight138,When I gave you to Crystal it’s because I knew she’d take good care of you.
goodnight138,What I didn’t foresee was that like I had once, she needed you.
goodnight138,I think of you from time to time.
goodnight138,I hope you still get chances to hop around outside and nibble yummy leaves.
goodnight138,I wish you were here, but I’m so glad that you give some one else all your bunny reasons to smile.
goodnight138,
goodnight116,
goodnight116,Can I tell you a little secret?
goodnight116,It’s one that’s nagged at me for most of my life, eating a way slowly at my conscious, my soul, and my self esteem.
goodnight116,Here it goes... I use to think I was evil.
goodnight116,Seriously.
goodnight116,I’m the girl with the bad vibe who your parents told you to stay clear of.
goodnight116,I most certainly don’t look evil.
goodnight116,I’m very petite with a thin, angular face, and cat like eyes that change color.
goodnight116,I have long slender arms with delicate, frail wrists.
goodnight116,Physically, I don’t look strong nor intimidating.
goodnight116,I will admit I’m one of those people who have facial expressions that always seem to range upon annoyance.
goodnight116,Those who know me know you really can’t judge my thoughts by face.
goodnight116,They don’t act in accord.
goodnight116,I most certainly don’t act evil although I must admit, I was a very rambunctious youth.
goodnight116,I have a limitless amount of energy.
goodnight116,I’m always moving and sometimes I just can’t seem to shut up.
goodnight116,I have a huge heart.
goodnight116,I always want to offer up good, sound advice or a positive solution.
goodnight116,I love to learn about people, make friends, compliment every pleasing thing I see.
goodnight116,I literally long to make other people happy and I expect nothing back in return.
goodnight116,That’s why in the past, I’ve had such a hard time with people.
goodnight116,Something about me draws them close.
goodnight116,Once I’m happy with this new found blossoming relationship something goes wrong.
goodnight116,My new buddy pulls away, withdraws like I am a cursed leper and I’m left wondering “What did I do?” “What did I say?” It use to really hurt me deep, but now I’ve learned to just let it be.
goodnight116,Move on, be myself, that’s all I can do.
goodnight116,I’ve never killed anyone.
goodnight116,Very few times do I think I was a bully.
goodnight116,I’m not violent.
goodnight116,I try not to lie, nor gossip, nor cause drama.
goodnight116,I don’t cheat.
goodnight116,I don’t steal.
goodnight116,I can pick apart my strengths and my weaknesses.
goodnight116,I never quite understood why people acted like I was a bad omen.
goodnight116,I may never know all the reasons for it.
goodnight116,The truth is I’ve learned a great lesson.
goodnight116,I have learned to rise above it and ignore it.
goodnight116,I can be no more than my true self.
goodnight116,Others are well within their personal rights to not like me even if it’s for no reason or one that makes no sense.
goodnight116,I won’t push back with the coldness they’ve given me.
goodnight116,I’ll keep a smile on my face and take stock of all that I am blessed with.
goodnight116,I won’t waste my energy holding grudges.
goodnight116,I’m not a resentful person.
goodnight116,I am light and like light, I bounce.
goodnight116,For many years I thought I was cursed, born evil, forever damned.
goodnight116,I tried not to let it hold me under because it was out of my realm of control.
goodnight116,Then one day I had an overwhelming epiphany.
goodnight116,Goodness is a choice.
goodnight116,Evil is a choice.
goodnight116,It’s not a condition that you are born with.
goodnight116,You are evil when you actively choose to be morally corrupt.
goodnight116,If I do not act in a vile manner how can I possibly be “simply” bad.
goodnight116,I can not.
goodnight116,I am not a victim of circumstance.
goodnight116,I have free will.
goodnight116,So you see, I was wrong to let people’s misjudgements weigh so heavily on my soul.
goodnight116,In the end their judgements can hold no candle to the love that is in my heart.
goodnight116,In fact, I feel sorry for them.
goodnight116,I give them my peace and love instead. 
goodnight116, 
goodnight116,
goodnight93,
goodnight93,I’m actually planning on blogging about an idea for a specific topic today, but before I dive into that subject matter I’d like to share an overview of my day so far.
goodnight93,Yesterday Snoochie picked me some wild flowers that have already started to bloom in our back yard.
goodnight93,Delicate white flowers with little green dashes at the tips of the petals and purple star shaped flowers now sit on my bed side table.
goodnight93,The aroma is intoxicating and reminds me of a floral perfume.
goodnight93,I’m not the only one in the house enjoying the sweet bouquet.
goodnight93,Jake, our kitten, keeps leaning in to inhale the fragrance.
goodnight93,This morning I awoke to the sound of hysterical screaming and crying.
goodnight93,Still half asleep, my heart pounded in my chest and a lump immediately swelled in my throat.
goodnight93,Did one of the cats die?
goodnight93,I quickly opened my bedroom door and realized the screaming was coming from my overly dramatic Snoochie.
goodnight93,She stole one of Bobo’s sneakers and was cruelly playing keep-a-way.
goodnight93,Aggravated, Bobo shoved his little sister on to the floor and took back his shoe.
goodnight93,The Man stepped in and separated them.
goodnight93,Really not a great way to wake up.
goodnight93,Today’s work out went fantastic!
goodnight93,I jogged at a steady pace for 20 minutes.
goodnight93,I read a few articles about how to effectively exercise and they mentioned using short, intense bursts of energy into a steady paced workout.
goodnight93,This is supposed to help speed up your metabolism.
goodnight93,So at every 5 minute interval I ran like a bat out of hell for 45 seconds.
goodnight93,After my jog, I did some basic steps.
goodnight93,My rhythm is improving.
goodnight93,At some point I’d like to make up a step routine of my own.
goodnight93,I did some strength training (alternating lunges and turbo twists).
goodnight93,Today I ended my routine with yoga instead of starting with it.
goodnight93,I must admit I am still a little sore, but not nearly as bad as I felt yesterday.
goodnight93,Once I started moving around, my legs and aching thighs gave no indication of the strenuous torture I’ve been putting them through these past few days.
goodnight93,I have a hunch that tomorrow these aches and pains will be even less of a nuisance to me than they were today.
goodnight93,I don’t have to work until 4pm tomorrow so I’ll be able to work out in the morning.
goodnight93,A few nights ago Deedee sat by my side while I was blogging.
goodnight93,She was very curious about all the different things I like to write about and read.
goodnight93,She confessed to having a blog of her own that remains entry-less because she never knows what to write about.
goodnight93,We discussed all the different choices for a topic she could use: her day, her dreams, her opinions, random stories, you can literally pull a topic out of a hat I explained.
goodnight93,So I too, have decided to write my thoughts on a seemingly random topic.
goodnight93,In fact I picked one topic so big that I can divide it into 7 different blogs.
goodnight93,The Seven Deadly Sins.
goodnight93,I think I’m going to tackle vanity first.
goodnight93,That’s what my next entry will be all about.
goodnight93,
goodnight108,
goodnight108,I haven’t written on update of daily life stuff in awhile because there hasn’t been too much going on.
goodnight108,The Man’s work schedule has changed and we’ve finally started adjusting to it.
goodnight108,He went from being a 3rd shift warrior to working 2nd shift.
goodnight108,Ugh.
goodnight108,It’s disappointing because now he isn’t home during the week day evenings and doesn’t get to see the kids very much.
goodnight108,He wakes up early to see them off before school.
goodnight108,He is more tired than usual.
goodnight108,I work some evenings as well, but I always manage to get home before the kids bedtime.
goodnight108,Deedee has been a huge help.
goodnight108,She never ceases to amaze and impress me.
goodnight108,It’s so important that she knows how much I truly appreciate her.
goodnight108,Deedee got nominated for a field trip.
goodnight108,She’s going to learn about S.T.E.M.
goodnight108,I hope she likes the program.
goodnight108,Deedee always looks into the future.
goodnight108,She has it all mapped out.
goodnight108,I wanted to say so much more about our week, but I must apologize.
goodnight108,I’m exhausted.
goodnight108,It’s going to be a very early night tonight. 
goodnight108,
goodnight132,
goodnight132,I am here for another day.
goodnight132,My soul dances underneath the moon, growing stronger from the stars.
goodnight132,I am such a fortunate, lucky woman.
goodnight132,I may not have everything I want and need, but I have everything one truly needs.
goodnight132,I have my health, I have my family, I have a warm dry roof over my head, and I have a full belly.
goodnight132,Bad days come and go.
goodnight132,They are fleeting like a thunderstorm.
goodnight132,I have used the pain and agony that I have truly suffered.
goodnight132,I used the torment to forge myself into something strong, quick, filled with hope and love.
goodnight132,I hope that I can be an example.
goodnight132,I hope I can be regarded as kind.
goodnight132,I hope my words will be heard as wise.
goodnight132,My soul is older than a time I can even imagine.
goodnight132,I do not know the full purpose of me rebirth.
goodnight132,Is it a gift or a punishment?
goodnight132,I suppose since as long as I live and breath, the reason doesn’t matter.
goodnight132,The important thing is that I am.
goodnight132,
goodnight111,
goodnight111,As a child and young adult, I never slowed down enough to realize the biggest pressing matter which would inevitably consume me whole.
goodnight111,I would be utterly powerless in its grasp.
goodnight111,Despite having relatives and even a good friend pass on it didn’t occur to me, that I too will one day be no more.
goodnight111,When my belly was swollen and full with unborn life getting ready to make its grand entrance, it hit me hard like a stone wall.
goodnight111,This life in me came from seemingly no where.
goodnight111,Sure, I know the scientific process and all that... but think about one moment I am me, next I am a creator.
goodnight111,As easily as my sweet babe can enter this world, her exit could be faster.
goodnight111,If she can go.
goodnight111,I can go.
goodnight111,Finally my mortality terrified me.
goodnight111,Awake in the night, I tried not to cry.
goodnight111,Crippling panic weld up inside me.
goodnight111,It took a few years, but I’ve made my peace.
goodnight111,I no longer worry about this absolute fact.
goodnight111,No matter what I do, I can not stop it.
goodnight111,So I go on.
goodnight111,I live my life.
goodnight111,I love my life.
goodnight111,It’s precious to me.
goodnight111,I take the time to value myself, my family, and everything that makes me smile.
goodnight111,It’s amazing and I will take the time to enjoy it until the very end.
goodnight111, 
goodnight111, 
goodnight111,
goodnight139,
goodnight139,The last time I saw snow falling down, I was running away.
goodnight139,I made the decision to get a fresh start in life.
goodnight139,This choice meant picking up my kids and moving, 1000 miles a way.
goodnight139,I have yet to regret it.
goodnight139,I needed clarity and to remove myself from seriously, negative people who caused so much drama that it seriously scarred my life.
goodnight139,The night I left it all behind snow and hail followed me through 3 states.
goodnight139,I spent time by the ocean.
goodnight139,I healed.
goodnight139,A bigger picture of what and how I want my life to be was revealed.
goodnight139,I finally figured out how to break free of the walls of my past.
goodnight139,This morning I was woken up by my phone ringing way too early for me.
goodnight139,Annoyed, I answered it.
goodnight139,An automated message told me that school all across the district was closed today.
goodnight139,I got out of bed, told the girls so they could sleep in, and I went back to sleep.
goodnight139,When I woke up again (at a normal hour), I peaked out the window.
goodnight139,It was raining.
goodnight139,Not a single snow flake on the ground.
goodnight139,I’m from New England.
goodnight139,If this is what the South calls a “snow day” ....
goodnight139,it’s kind of a joke, no offense.
goodnight139,I realize that South Carolina’s DPW probably doesn’t have the resources to deal with icy roads, snow accumulation, etc.
goodnight139,However, my kids were missing school on account of some cold rain.
goodnight139,Seriously?
goodnight139,I had to work at 4.
goodnight139,As I left the house Bobo and Snoochie were trying to make a snow man out of the first few falling flakes (keep in mind, by the time any of this snow actually started to stick the kids would have been home from school already).
goodnight139,Once at work a few people called out and one guy never showed up.
goodnight139,We were dead for awhile, but as the night wore on business picked up since we were the ONLY place open.
goodnight139,Eventually we got the call to close early.
goodnight139,Patrons were seriously aggravated and annoyed with us.
goodnight139,By the time I left work my car was encased in a sheet of ice.
goodnight139,It took 15 minutes for my windows to be defrosted enough for me to be able to drive.
goodnight139,I made it down the street, stopped for a red light, and felt the breaks lock up, and the car slid.
goodnight139,I drove with care the rest of the ride home and it was uneventful other than passing by other cars on the road that were literally crawling at 15 mph and sliding everywhere.
goodnight139,Some one needs to teach these southerners how to properly BRAKE in icy conditions.
goodnight139,South Carolina doesn’t have any requirements regarding safety inspections for vehicles on the road.
goodnight139,This means that the road ways are filled with cars that really aren’t all that safe and are driving right next to you.
goodnight139,I imagine there’s a large amount of cars that have tires with seriously bad tread – no wonder why they freak out about driving in snow or ice – their cars aren’t safe to begin with.
goodnight139,shm...
goodnight139,I won’t lie though, it’s nice to see the snow, only if it’s a micro inch coating.
goodnight139,It reminds me of all the bullshit I left behind and reinforces that I am on the right track!
goodnight139,ps the attempted snow man build was a total flop
goodnight139,ps the picture is of Deedee, back in New England, taken during what we thought to be one of the last snow falls we’d see in a very long while,
goodnight139,
goodnight85,
goodnight85,In moments of depression, anxiety, uncertainty I grasp on to the same M.O.
goodnight85,I need to change something, make it different, make it my own.
goodnight85,I’ve gone through several dozens different hair colors, piercings, and of course I’ve got a few tattoos.
goodnight85,I’ve given up most of the piercings.
goodnight85,These days I rock 2 simple ear piercings and I am content with that.
goodnight85,I have a scar on the edge of my right ear brow from an old bar bell.
goodnight85,Don’t plan on ever re-piercing it again.
goodnight85,It’s the same with my navel.
goodnight85,I got it pierced when I was 18.
goodnight85,I took the ring out when I got pregnant.
goodnight85,Don’t really care to show off my tummy anymore.
goodnight85,I have daughters that look to me for guidance.
goodnight85,Tonight I’m sitting on a sheet in my living room with color stripper in my hair.
goodnight85,I’m done with my red locks.
goodnight85,Time for something new.
goodnight85,My plan is to go as blond as possible.
goodnight85,I’m nervous and tentative.
goodnight85,I know from past experience it is really difficult to dye red hair blond.
goodnight85,So I’m using color oops and crossing my fingers.
goodnight85,Oh man do I hope I don’t wind up with Ronald McDonald orange hair.
goodnight85,It’s happened to me once before.
goodnight85,When Deedee was about 2 years old I attempted to dye my hair to be as golden blond as hers.
goodnight85,It was a miserable, epic failure.
goodnight85,I was horrified by the shocking orange color.
goodnight85,I re-dyed it something darker to fix it and that was that.
goodnight85,I’ve never tried to dye my thick locks blond again.
goodnight85,The irony is, I was born blond.
goodnight85,I’ve also used supposedly temporary black dye on my hair for a special occasion.
goodnight85,HUGE mistake.
goodnight85,I had to grow the hair out that was way too dark for my complexion.
goodnight85,It took about 2 years.
goodnight85,Since my two dyeing catastrophes I’ve played it safe and stuck to reds and browns ever since.
goodnight85,I’m tired of looking the same way.
goodnight85,I live in a new state, have a new job, slowly changing my wardrobe.
goodnight85,I’d like a new hair color to go along with it.
goodnight85,I’ve got enough tattoos and piercings anyways.
goodnight85,
goodnight142,
goodnight142,I am an awakened, spirituality conscious individual.
goodnight142,I am aware that my energy connects to every every other life force on this planet.
goodnight142,It is all connected.
goodnight142,We are all connect and tapped into the very core of the Earth.
goodnight142,The elements are a key source of power.
goodnight142,Intention is a stronger force of will than one might expect.
goodnight142,The key to life is simple.
goodnight142,Live your life.
goodnight142,Live it the way you want too.
goodnight142,I interpret that to mean enjoy each day that I have life.
goodnight142,Live to the fullest.
goodnight142,Both sentiments are not always possible.
goodnight142,I’d rather make the most of each day which various bumps and obstacles included.
goodnight142,Love yourself.
goodnight142,Your life is for you so give it meaningful value.
goodnight142,Sure, you can love others too.
goodnight142,But you can not truly love anyone else until you love yourself for all that you AND all that you are not.
goodnight142,Make peace with the fact that you are not perfect.
goodnight142,No one is, so we must learn out short comings are perfectly acceptable.
goodnight142,Embrace your flaws.
goodnight142,I find it a good philosophy to strive to be perfect and accept what is actuality.
goodnight142,In the thick of all your relationships, do not have expectations.
goodnight142,Always act with that logic in your mind.
goodnight142,If you work hard, give selflessly in the hopes of receiving praise, acknowledgement, or anything in return you will be disappointed.
goodnight142,Act for yourself instead.
goodnight142,Everything else will fall into place.
goodnight142,If you are in a negative mind set you should change your thinking.
goodnight142,The only thing you have true control over in this world is yourself.
goodnight142,Think and act with this in mind.
goodnight142,The human mind is amazing and we only use a small percentage of it.
goodnight142,Awaken and the possibilities will become endless.
goodnight142,Remember the 7 chakras.
goodnight142,Open them all.
goodnight142,Work to undo the blocks.
goodnight142,In a future blog I will go deeper into this.
goodnight142,Have a beautiful day.
goodnight142,Love yourself.
goodnight142,Love the world around you.
goodnight142,
goodnight136,
goodnight136,It’s not if often that I say this...
goodnight136,But I am aggravated, irritated, frustrated, and annoyed.
goodnight136,Can’t wait to go to sleep and be done with today... only problem is, I’m an insomiac.
goodnight136,Every one else is the house is soundly sleeping except for me.
goodnight136,I swear the corners of my eyes are twitching.
goodnight136,It isn’t a big deal, I swear.
goodnight136,6 hour shift under big boss in a mediocre mood.
goodnight136,He makes no sense.
goodnight136,He has no rhyme or reason.
goodnight136,He lacks people skills.
goodnight136,I’m sure there is plenty he is good at.
goodnight136,He expected me to snatch a utensil out of his hand tonight because it was what I NEEDED to get food out (a spatula to get burgers off the grill).
goodnight136,Instead I took some wax paper, wrapped it around the spatula I shouldn’t use (cross contaminated) and finished my work.
goodnight136,I was smug with satisfaction.
goodnight136,Great problem solving skills, Inanna.
goodnight136,Yeah... not so much.
goodnight136,Big boss tells me next time to just grab it from him.
goodnight136,Say what?
goodnight136,Are we in preschool squabbling over who gets a turn with the big blocks?
goodnight136,I made it through.
goodnight136,Its only 6 hours and it’s a paycheck.
goodnight136,I get home and the man is drunk.
goodnight136,Wouldn’t have been so bad if he didn’t keep playing too rough with the kids, got me rounded up to drive him to the store to get smokes only to decide that all the good stores are probably closed.
goodnight136,Yup, I felt like I was in preschool all day today... only with adults.  
goodnight136, 
goodnight136,
goodnight90,
goodnight90,How often these days can I sit back, reflect, and think “life is good”?
goodnight90,Frequently.
goodnight90,The funny thing is I mean it.
goodnight90,My life is great.
goodnight90,No, I am not famous (not that I want to be anyways).
goodnight90,No, I’m not rich (not big into material stuff anyways).
goodnight90,I have everything I need though.
goodnight90,Today was especially great.
goodnight90,Yes, I’m not into material things all that much, but sometimes a shopping trip is fun.
goodnight90,I can’t deny it.
goodnight90,The Man took me to the mall today and let me go nuts.
goodnight90,Literally, I could get what ever I want.
goodnight90,I secretly suspect there was no set limit on today’s free for all because The Man knows I can’t stand wasting money.
goodnight90,He knew I’d get a few new outfits maybe a pair of shoes and that’d be it.
goodnight90,He was right.
goodnight90,I love my new clothes!!!
goodnight90,And my new sneakers are so freaking comfortable.
goodnight90,I had to wear my work sneakers all the time because my $8 pair of “what are those” family dollar wannbe converse were pretty much so ripped they were talking.
goodnight90,I have a sneaker fetish.
goodnight90,I love those sporty shoes.
goodnight90,I especially love big, puffy boy high types.
goodnight90,I love Air Jordans... like walking on a cloud.
goodnight90,I also really like Osiris’s, but they are a little hard to come by in the South.
goodnight90,I have really small feet so I can either get woman’s sneakers (bleh... so NOT me) or I can fit into boy’s sizes.
goodnight90,Yup.
goodnight90,I buy kids shoes.
goodnight90,I have to admit, The Man telling me today was only about me really felt nice deep inside.
goodnight90,I kept trying to get clothes he needs too, but he said not today.
goodnight90,He even carried every single bag around the mall.
goodnight90,Chivalry is not dead ladies!
goodnight90,So today I’m a spoiled brat.
goodnight90,It’s okay for just one day... right?
goodnight90, 
goodnight90,
goodnight118,
goodnight118,Some times I like to look back through my old journal entries.
goodnight118,It’s fun to revisit my past and reminisce.
goodnight118,So this entry is an update of what life is like in my house right now, what interests I have, and so on.
goodnight118,Just to warn anyone reading, I’m probably going to babble quite a bit.
goodnight118,Today is cold, but not as cold as it would be if I still lived up North
goodnight118,Today my favorite song is “Crossroads” by Avenge Sevenfold
goodnight118,Recently I got the kid’s progress reports.
goodnight118,Out of the three, Snoochie got the highest marks although the other 2 received approving marks as well.
goodnight118,I’m proud of all 3.
goodnight118,I burned my arm at work tonight.
goodnight118,It’s stinging me even as I type.
goodnight118,I just finished Vikings seasons 1 – 3.
goodnight118,I can’t wait for the next season to come out!
goodnight118,My favorite character is Floki and the trend has been for The Man and me to mimic him.
goodnight118,Yesterday was the Super bowl and the Broncos won.
goodnight118,I could care less.
goodnight118,I’m addicting to Cooking Fever (it’s a game).
goodnight118,I intend to download World Chef next.
goodnight118,I’ve fallen of the horse, so to speak.
goodnight118,My diet has been terrible lately.
goodnight118,I need a kick in the pants.
goodnight118,Toothless and Jake are bff’s today.
goodnight118,It’s super cute.
goodnight118,Could it be possible that she’s finally warming up to the kittens?
goodnight118,The Man bought me a huge heart shaped box full of delectable chocolates.
goodnight118,I’m in love.
goodnight118,I’m planning on dyeing my hair.
goodnight118,I want to go blond.
goodnight118,I think that’s probably enough to say for tonight
goodnight118, 
goodnight118,
goodnight83,
goodnight83,It’s just behind my eyes
goodnight83,The power to control you
goodnight83,Such a little effort
goodnight83,To have you wrapped around my fingers
goodnight83,Your beating heart is in my hands
goodnight83,I could squeeze the life right out of you
goodnight83,Turn you into my broken toy
goodnight83,Come play with the succubus
goodnight83,I’ll take every thing you’ve got
goodnight83,And you’ll still come back to me
goodnight83,I’m your obsession 
goodnight83,I’m your addiction
goodnight83,With one small look
goodnight83,I’ll leave you mesmerized 
goodnight83,You’re drawn in before you know
goodnight83,It’s too late for you to run away
goodnight83,I’ll infest your mind like a disease
goodnight83,I’ll find you in your dreams
goodnight83,Kneel before me in submission
goodnight83,Cause I’ll do as I please
goodnight83,I warned you before I got started
goodnight83,And now, you’re mine
goodnight83,You belong to me
goodnight83, 
goodnight83,
goodnight95,
goodnight95,My sunshine, rainbows, and kittens is slowly dissolving leaving mush in  my mouth and rocks in my stomach.
goodnight95,I know life will always have its ups and downs, meetings and partings, but sometimes good byes are too difficult to bear.
goodnight95,Last night, I let myself and my natural tendencies to get the better of me.
goodnight95,The result?
goodnight95,I took my unfounded suspicions, paranoia, and anxieties out on the man.
goodnight95,I feel terrible for this.
goodnight95,I’m grateful that he’s so kind hearted and understanding that he can see past this.
goodnight95,Maybe that’s because of the dark cloud from today.
goodnight95,We took one of our cats to the vet today.
goodnight95,The vet came highly recommended.
goodnight95,My sweet princess Toothless is on the decline, but she’s only 4 years old.
goodnight95,Her rear end is so tiny.
goodnight95,She’s lost so much weight.
goodnight95,Her coat is dull.
goodnight95,Her hind legs are so weak.
goodnight95,I’m watching her rot and mystified as to the cause.
goodnight95,I’ve been trying to eliminate the more obvious problems, but as to what’s going on with her, I only had suspicions.
goodnight95,Could be her kidneys.
goodnight95,Could be hyperthyroidism.
goodnight95,Could be allergies.
goodnight95,Could be cancer.
goodnight95,Guess what?
goodnight95,It’s cancer.
goodnight95,She has a tumor in her spine.
goodnight95,It’s bone cancer.
goodnight95,It’s inoperative.
goodnight95,No surgery can fix this.
goodnight95,Chemo isn’t an option.
goodnight95,She’s on borrowed time.
goodnight95,I fought my tears as I saw the X Ray of Toothless’s disintegrating spine.
goodnight95,Soon she will be paralyzed and we will have to put her down.
goodnight95,There is no miracle coming to save the day.
goodnight95,Only my tears.
goodnight95,I was sent home with pain medication to keep her comfortable.
goodnight95,I was sent home with no hope.
goodnight95,I have my love for her still though.
goodnight95,I have this final time to spend with her.
goodnight95,She’s still my sweet girl.
goodnight95,She still purrs and wants to be pet.
goodnight95,She still places her soft, velvet paws in the palm of my hand.
goodnight95,She still nips my fingers.
goodnight95,I still have time with her for at least a little while.
goodnight95,My kids will be coming home from school soon and I’ll have to face them with the truth.
goodnight95,I know she’s just a cat, but she’s so much more to us.
goodnight95,She’s a member of our family.
goodnight95,She’s softened our moments of pain.
goodnight95,She’s been that needed hug.
goodnight95,She’s been our shoulder to cry on.
goodnight95,She’s that giggle of sheer joy.
goodnight95,Now it’s our turn to care for her like she cares for us.
goodnight95,I can only hope that in these final days she knows she is loved.
goodnight95,

goodnight122,
goodnight122,Jacob Mark Pitts has a gleam in his eyes.
goodnight122,He prowls lightly on his feet with the fluid movements of an instinctual predator.
goodnight122,If he was larger, he wouldn’t think twice about killing you.
goodnight122,He sleeps up high above the fridge or on top of my wired shelf.
goodnight122,He’s obsessed with running water (and no, he is not diabetic).
goodnight122,He runs into the bathroom and sings at full volume.
goodnight122,“Meeeeer-ooooW-Kkkk”.
goodnight122,He loves to pronounce “Ka” sounds.
goodnight122,He’ll tell you a story if you ask.
goodnight122,He’s been known to break into bathroom and join us when we take showers.
goodnight122,It’s just too hilarious to make a more concentrated effort to kick him out.
goodnight122,He does not have the ferocious appetite his brother (Andrew Dennis Beirsack) has.
goodnight122,Jake cares very little when I shake his bag of treats.
goodnight122,It’s not enough to entice him to appear.
goodnight122,Andy, on the other hand, hears the treat drawer slide open from 2 rooms away.
goodnight122,Jake is very healthy compared to his brother.
goodnight122,Born into a litter of 5, Jacob was the runt.
goodnight122,He was chosen because of his slight, slender frame and for the markings on his forehead.
goodnight122,He is black, but his paws are white and he has 3 patches of white fur from his neck to his belly.
goodnight122,I made the mistake of switching his food to a different brand when the kittens were about 18 weeks old.
goodnight122,The store near my house doesn’t carry the brand I use.
goodnight122,Within 4 days of using the cheaper, more common brand, I watched in agony as Andy’s health sharply declined.
goodnight122,He was lethargic, he couldn’t get up to eat or drink.
goodnight122,His breathing grew rapid and shallow.
goodnight122,Jake saw his brother get sicker and sicker.
goodnight122,Jake abandoned his dieing brother.
goodnight122,I used a combination of TLC, science, and magick to save Andy.
goodnight122,I threw out what I suspected was tainted food.
goodnight122,I hand fed him.
goodnight122,I saged him.
goodnight122,I gave him a white light of my energy.
goodnight122,Andy survived, but because of his illness, Jake “the runt” was bigger than his brother.
goodnight122,Andy has fully recovered.
goodnight122,He’s happy and playful.
goodnight122,Jacob enjoys a sense of power now that he is as big as his brother.
goodnight122,When I get home from work Jake and Andy greet me at the door.
goodnight122,They make me smile.
goodnight122,There is something therapeutic in petting a cat. 
goodnight122,
goodnight147,
goodnight147,I hate being a flake.
goodnight147,The list of things I want to accomplish is massive.
goodnight147,What I ACTUALLY manage to do is fairly meager.
goodnight147,For example my adhd can run rampant if I’m not actively attempting to keep it in check.
goodnight147,Most of the time I can... unless I’m around another high energy person.
goodnight147,So far at the new job I’ve managed to stay on task and focus... tonight however, I got distracted.
goodnight147,Its my own damn fault.
goodnight147,I’m well aware of my tendencies.
goodnight147,It just sucks to have to actively shut my crazy switch off so I can function like a semi-normal human.
goodnight147,Oh but there’s medication I can take for it!
goodnight147,Thanks, but no thanks.
goodnight147,I’d rather reach deep inside of me to train myself to concentrate, alleviate pain, and so on.
goodnight147,I don’t like taking pills to solve a problem.
goodnight147,To me, that is the essence of dependency.
goodnight147,My plan was to get my emt training and pass the certification exams.
goodnight147,I really feel this field of work would be the best way for me to utilize my body as well as my mind.
goodnight147,Orginally the plan was for me to concentrate on this alone.
goodnight147,Did it happen?
goodnight147,Am I signed up for a single course?
goodnight147,No.
goodnight147,I’m not.
goodnight147,I do have a new job though and income.
goodnight147,Its not like I’ve been idle with me time.
goodnight147,I do need to buckle down though and speak to the admissions department so I can at least be on the right path.
goodnight147,In parting I’ll say this: The new year is almost here.
goodnight147,2016 will be dedicated towards furthering my future: body, mind, and soul.
goodnight147,I’m getting depressed thinking about my future crack down on soda.
goodnight147,Good bye Mountain Dew.
goodnight147,I’ll miss you.
goodnight147,
goodnight106,
goodnight106,The winds howled fiercely today.
goodnight106,Broken tree limbs sailed past my window.
goodnight106,The house shook.
goodnight106,It would seem as if the Ides of March have come in early this year, in like a lion out like a lamb.
goodnight106,Yesterday night Snoochie did the dishes (it’s her assigned chore).
goodnight106,The seal on one of the pipes couldn’t hold up and the kitchen flooded.
goodnight106,How lovely... I kept my calm through this mild disaster.
goodnight106,Sometimes I like to embrace the chaos life throws at me.
goodnight106,Snoochie helped me clear out the cabinets below the sink and mop up all the gross standing water.
goodnight106,This morning my handyman, The Man fixed the sink.
goodnight106,Life goes on.
goodnight106,After ranting about my weight and spring time goals in my blog yesterday, I fired up the yee ole wii fit.
goodnight106,I’ve gained ten pounds since last year.
goodnight106,Oh crap.
goodnight106,It may not seem like a lot, but trust me, it is.
goodnight106,I’ve always been that awkward skinny girl who could cram anything I wanted down my throat and never gain an ounce.
goodnight106,I’ve actually had people seriously accuse me of being anorexic before and they’ve tried to stage an intervention.
goodnight106,Their false assumptions amused me.
goodnight106,I eat like a total pig... in fact, my diet was total crap back in my skeletor days.
goodnight106,Add that to the fact that I don’t routinely exercise and I never have.
goodnight106,Yes, I am energetic and yes, I am always in motion... but you’d never see me running miles around town.
goodnight106,What I had was a fast metabolism.
goodnight106,Now that I’ve actually gained and held on to some weight, I am facing the fact that my metabolism has slowed down.
goodnight106,I’m aging.
goodnight106,These are the facts that I must face.
goodnight106,The kids had a blast watching me run on the wii, do step aerobics, and tried out some yoga.
goodnight106,After just two days of a 30 minute work out my thighs are aching!
goodnight106,I will not let this deter me and secretly I love the burning pain.
goodnight106,It’s a sign of my hard work.
goodnight106,If I’m sore tomorrow I plan on sucking it up, take some Aleve, and stay true to my regiment.
goodnight106,All I have to do is lose 10 pounds.
goodnight106,I am realistically giving myself 2 months to accomplish this.
goodnight106,I know I’ve got what it takes.
goodnight106,The Man was in a mood this morning.
goodnight106,I thought about it on the dark drive home from work tonight.
goodnight106,We’re experiencing a minor drift.
goodnight106,He is so important to me.
goodnight106,I choose him.
goodnight106,I love him.
goodnight106,I’d like to take some of his stress and frustration a way.
goodnight106,I need to leave in an hour to go pick him up from work.
goodnight106,He didn’t sleep good last night hence his grumpy cat exterior today.
goodnight106,My plan is to give him a nice back rub before he falls asleep.
goodnight106,I’m not a very outwardly affectionate person and sometimes I forget how important physical human contact can be to others.
goodnight106,You see, as an empath who ever touches me (or vice versa) causes me to feel their emotions.
goodnight106,It can be an overwhelming , over stimulating experience.
goodnight106,It’s not always pleasant.
goodnight106,You can not hide your true self from me.
goodnight106,When I have physical contact with other people it’s as intimate as them being naked in front of me.
goodnight106,With The Man it doesn’t matter.
goodnight106,We have nothing to hide from each other.
goodnight106,I had made a habit of avoiding contact so unfortunately I neglect the ones I love, like The Man.
goodnight106,He’s too bashful and grown-up to seek me out for hugs like my sweet babies do.
goodnight106,The wind is still roaring.
goodnight106,I can hear the snap of branches as a type.
goodnight106,I can hear debris flutter along the road.
goodnight106,Toothless (my kitty) is sleeping soundly in her bed next to mine.
goodnight106,Andy and Jake are chirping out in the hallway.
goodnight106,I really love my life. 
goodnight106,
goodnight101,
goodnight101,A year ago I could barely stand the sight of him... or myself.
goodnight101,He represented all those demons stirring inside me that I desperately wanted to cast into exile.
goodnight101,Every day we were trapped in the same, numb routine.
goodnight101,I tried so hard to put my foot down.
goodnight101,I really did.
goodnight101,Too bad I was utterly failing myself, my dreams, and my convictions.
goodnight101,As the snow flew in a furious white blanket, blinding our eyes and freezing our exposed skin a different kind of storm raged through my mind.
goodnight101,I love you, but this is too much.
goodnight101,You are my destruction.
goodnight101,I can never get better in this toxic stew.
goodnight101,Temperatures dropped.
goodnight101,Glass shattered.
goodnight101,So did my heart.
goodnight101,The moment had been forced by his hand, not mine.
goodnight101,I did what I had to do.
goodnight101,I did it to save my own life.
goodnight101,It was by far the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make.
goodnight101,I didn’t even get the chance to say goodbye.
goodnight101,There was nothing to fall back on.
goodnight101,I was on my own.
goodnight101,No more could I invoke his name in my own self destruction.
goodnight101,There was no one, but me.
goodnight101,It was lonely at the bottom, but at least I could only rise.
goodnight101,Surely I had sunk down as far as I could go.
goodnight101,Months went by and I realized just how much I missed him.
goodnight101,It’s funny how the sun still shines even when you’re dieing on the inside.
goodnight101,He’s always had my heart.
goodnight101,Without him it didn’t beat quite the same any more.
goodnight101,I couldn’t go on with the ghost of my past.
goodnight101,Only eagerly inch forward and with increasing momentum I grew strong.
goodnight101,Eventually we had to speak and we did.
goodnight101,It was tense those first few times.
goodnight101,We couldn’t even hold a conversation without ripping each other to pieces.
goodnight101,That’s when I realized how much I’d hurt him and it was every bit as sour as he had made me feel.
goodnight101,Pain the great equalizer, like birth, and like death.
goodnight101,Neither of us can take back the past.
goodnight101,Baby steps became steady.
goodnight101,I heard happiness and pride in his voice.
goodnight101,Whether or not we would every be together again no longer mattered.
goodnight101,We BOTH deserve happiness.
goodnight101,I realized if we did want to try again, it’d have to be a whole new relationship.
goodnight101,I could never bring up anything from the past to hold against him.
goodnight101,More importantly I needed to forgive him.
goodnight101,Forgiveness, giving it was a rush.
goodnight101,A huge weight lifted off me.
goodnight101,I wouldn’t want every mistake I make or flaw I have recited to me over and over... so why hadn’t I held him to the same standard.
goodnight101,So when is too much enough... when you are no longer yourself.
goodnight101,When your future is at stake.
goodnight101,When you are being physically hurt.
goodnight101,When is it not enough?
goodnight101,When you are fortunate enough to have that rare partner who is willing to work with you every step of the way to climb from hell to heaven. 
goodnight101,
goodnight143,
goodnight143,Some people are “cat” people.
goodnight143,Some people are “dog” people.
goodnight143,There are even people who aren’t big on pets altogether or maybe they are content with some colorful fish.
goodnight143,Different strokes for different folks.
goodnight143,Me, I’ve always been a dog person.
goodnight143,Its how I was brought up (not too mention my mum is terribly allergic to cats so they were never a real option).
goodnight143,I grew up close in age to the family dog so much so that he was more like a sibling than pet.
goodnight143,Losing him was like losing a brother.
goodnight143,Hands down he was the most loyal and intelligent animal I’ve ever had the privilege of knowing.
goodnight143,Dogs require a lot of money, time, attention, and space.
goodnight143,I miss not having a dog, but my situation doesn’t seem fair to thrust a dog into.
goodnight143,In my house, we have cats.
goodnight143,Jake and Andy, my idiotic kittens are a serious dose of cuteness and therapy.
goodnight143,I love their independent streaks.
goodnight143,Originally I planned to take just one of them in, but something about the way they are instantly made me realize I couldn’t separate them.
goodnight143,They are best friends as well as brothers.
goodnight143,Andy was the mama’s boy of the liter.
goodnight143,He could easily be a fat cat.
goodnight143,He loves to fetch his toy mouse, kinda like a dog.
goodnight143,He’s fiercely protective over his food and his little brother.
goodnight143,The markings on his face give his expression a comical quality.
goodnight143,We call it derpy.
goodnight143,Jake was the runt.
goodnight143,His streamline shape and graceful movements remind me of a tiger on the hunt.
goodnight143,He’s vocal and loves the sound of his own voice.
goodnight143,Sometimes he sounds like a pigeon.
goodnight143,He loves to rub his head against mine. 
goodnight143,
goodnight117,
goodnight117,Today was the big day.
goodnight117,The girls were so excited.
goodnight117,Ladies Day with grandma included a trip to the hair dresser (which in this household is an extremely rare indulgence).
goodnight117,Snoochie had been counting down the days since last week.
goodnight117,I have a long, awkward history when it comes to going to a professional to get my hair done.
goodnight117,It never ever comes out the way I wanted it.
goodnight117,On top of that, they always “discover” my curls and I end up leaving feeling like a mortified poodle.
goodnight117,I paid money to have my precious hair violated.
goodnight117,There’s only been one hair dresser in my life who cut, styled, and dyed my hair the way I liked it.
goodnight117,That’s it.
goodnight117,Out of a legion of scissor holding trained stylists just the one was up to snuff.
goodnight117,The worst ever experience was when I was about 10 years old.
goodnight117,We were just about done and as I peaked in the mirror I was digging my cute pixie bob.
goodnight117,Suddenly the hair dresser buzzed the back of my head with clippers.
goodnight117,Oh no!!!
goodnight117,She actually gave me a duck’s ass.
goodnight117,I couldn’t face going to school the next day.
goodnight117,The front of my head looked amazing, but in the back... oh my!
goodnight117,To this day I cringe when I hear electric clippers buzzing maniacally.
goodnight117,When I was a teenager I stopped going to hair salons.
goodnight117,Long locks are pretty too after all.
goodnight117,When necessary I cut and dyed my own hair.
goodnight117,I was satisfied with the results and if I screwed up, I only had myself to blame.
goodnight117,Sometimes I’d find that rare gem of a friend who’d cut my hair for me and honestly, they always did a better job than the professionals.
goodnight117,In their younger years I cut my kid’s hair myself.
goodnight117,Deedee had straight blond so I’d just trim it and give her some bangs.
goodnight117,Snoochie is a different matter.
goodnight117,She has wild, crazy curly hair.
goodnight117,No matter what I did with it, her hair just bounces back into a mass of wild tangles.
goodnight117,One time I gave Snoochie bangs.
goodnight117,It was a huge mistake.
goodnight117,Lesson learned the hard way.
goodnight117,Nowadays I try to straighten her hair as much as possible.
goodnight117,As for Deedee, she cuts her hair herself.
goodnight117,She dyes it herself.
goodnight117,So far she’s had pretty good luck as far as her hair is concerned.
goodnight117,She lives for manic panic.
goodnight117,The girl’s special day ended later than anticipated.
goodnight117,A little after 10 pm the girls were dropped off.
goodnight117,Snoochie now rocks a soft bob and now has blond high lights!
goodnight117,It’s so cute.
goodnight117,Some one tamed Snoochie’s angry hair.
goodnight117,Deedee... on the other hand....
goodnight117,her hair has been hacked.
goodnight117,Her hair is way too short, uneven, and her bangs stick out.
goodnight117,She’s miserable.
goodnight117,She’s home from school today and keeps bursting into tears.
goodnight117,It’s obvious the poor hair dresser has little to no experience with emo hair cuts (especially choppy layers) and my sweet Deedee is paying the price.
goodnight117,So now I’m looking at wigs, extensions, or for a hair dresser with a little more experience.
goodnight117,I hope we can compromise and find something for her.
goodnight117,I can’t leave her like this.
goodnight117,Edited to add: The Man and I took Emily to another hair salon today.
goodnight117,The hair dresser (Helena) made a miracle out of a terrible hair cut.
goodnight117,It’s super short and styled into a striking emo do and more importantly, Deedee absolutely loves it.
goodnight117,So step-grandma spends $80 on a cut and Deedee hates it.
goodnight117,Dad spends $15 on a hair cut and Deedee feels like a rock star! 
goodnight117,
goodnight140,
goodnight140,There’s this huge news story going on right now... a two year old boy is missing.
goodnight140,Most likely he’s in some deep woods in Tennessee.
goodnight140,He slipped away from his grandma and no one has seen him since.
goodnight140,He disappeared a week ago.
goodnight140,I can’t help but get sucked up into the story like it’s a vortex.
goodnight140,I found myself frequently checking for updates as the days, hours, minutes go by.
goodnight140,My attention was, is drawn in deep.
goodnight140,I read the stories and comments.
goodnight140,I never gave my opinion on anything even though theories play out in my mind.
goodnight140,My emotions tug and pull.
goodnight140,The horror of a lost, cold, small child eats at my heart.
goodnight140,Then there was this afternoon...
goodnight140,3:10 pm and the school bus hadn’t rolled up yet.
goodnight140,By 3:15 pm I’ve got the creeps.
goodnight140,No intuition kicking into over drive yet, but my mind started to race.
goodnight140,3:20 pm Snoochie’s bus should have stopped at the house by now.
goodnight140,I’m trying to remember what Snoochie wore to school today.
goodnight140,My description would be “A girl with bright blew eyes, a leopard spotted jacket in blue tones, and crazy, curly brown hair”.
goodnight140,3:25 And I decide if she doesn’t come home by the time Bobo’s and Deedee’s bus drops them off I am officially beginning the frantic search.
goodnight140,The first 24 hours are crucial!
goodnight140,At 3:30 the school bus stops in front of the house.
goodnight140,Deedee and Bobo saunter in the house at their usual arrival time.
goodnight140,Snoochie was 20 minutes late.
goodnight140,Her bus driver forgot to stop at the house before he went to the middle school to reload the bus with more homeward bound students.
goodnight140,She was home though.
goodnight140,That’s what matters.
goodnight140,I can squish her with hugs.
goodnight140,I can kiss her cheeks til they’re red.
goodnight140,I can tell her “I love you” one more time.
goodnight140,I am the luckiest woman alive.
goodnight140,I have my baby.
goodnight140,She’s safe.
goodnight140,Last night was really cold, below freezing.
goodnight140,I turned the heat up so they kids would sleep comfortably.
goodnight140,I curled my blanket tightly around me.
goodnight140,I don’t see how a 2 year old in a long sleeved shirt and jeans can survive this frigid cold air.
goodnight140,Today it hailed and snowed for a short while.
goodnight140,I don’t see any chance of survival for a boy lost in the woods in this weather.
goodnight140,My heart aches.
goodnight140,I don’t know Noah Chamberlin, but I’m terrified for him.
goodnight140,Has his parents begun to give up hope?
goodnight140,Do they stay faithful and without doubt that they’ll see their little boy again.
goodnight140,I’m sorry for what they are going through.
goodnight140,I never want to be in their shoes.
goodnight140,One huge comfort I will have tonight is that my fabulous trio is safe and sound with me tonight.
goodnight140,I will remember how easily and quickly things can go wrong.
goodnight140,I will use this as a stark, fresh reminder that it is always time to live in the moment and cherish life and love with all of my heart.
goodnight140,I shall never take a hug for granted.
goodnight140,Update: Today they found the little boy.
goodnight140,Unfortunately, it was too late.
goodnight140,The past few days have been a mix of wet and cold... I didn’t think it would be possible for the lil’ guy to make it through this with some sort of miracle or divine intervention and sadly, I was right.
goodnight140,My personal opinion on the matter: He died Tuesday night.
goodnight140,He had no jacket, no hat, no food, and no water.
goodnight140,I think he was a fighter though.
goodnight140,I think he managed to survive the first couple of days, but exhaustion took its toll.
goodnight140,Yet again I will go to bed tonight thankful my babies are safe and sound under my roof.
goodnight140, 
goodnight140,
goodnight87,
goodnight87,It started from the moment Deedee could put crayon to paper.
goodnight87,She delighted in drawing all the splendour of her world.
goodnight87,After coating my fridge in her 18 month old drawings, I made a startlingly revelation.
goodnight87,Deedee always drew people and animals with a secondary outside outline.
goodnight87,She’d shade the areas in between her subject with a very specific color code.
goodnight87,Whenever she drew a picture of me, sure enough there’d be this brownish green outline around my figure.
goodnight87,When she was older, I was able to get to the bottom of this mystery.
goodnight87,Deedee sees auras.
goodnight87,If she were to look at you, she’d see colored lights emitting from all around you.
goodnight87,Every person has their own specific color.
goodnight87,Upon my initial awakening, I did not see in terms of what Deedee sees.
goodnight87,I could see a light around living beings with maybe a tinge of color, most tinged towards gold or blue.
goodnight87,What Deedee sees so deeply is the energy that you are made of.
goodnight87,You emit a color scheme of light all around you, whether you see it or not.
goodnight87,Now, I see it too, but not as spectacular as Deedee sees it.
goodnight87,It’s not as defined.
goodnight87,Did you know dear reader that when you write I FEEL how you feel, not what you say and from afar I can pick up traces of your aura.
goodnight87,What’s in your heart is no secret to me.
goodnight87,While you write cryptic poetry or write a short paragraph about your day... I, Ianna see the depths of your very soul.
goodnight87,You’ve been warned.
goodnight87,However, fear not.
goodnight87,Tis not my place to speak on your behalf.
goodnight87,You be you and I’ll be me.
goodnight87,Whaa O, Amber is the color or energy
goodnight87,Oh and incase you were wondering, mine is green with a very golden yellow light.
goodnight87,
goodnight103,
goodnight103,Once the sun fades over the horizon, after the sky shines pink and purple, my moon rises up high to greet me.
goodnight103,It’s light is pale and hollow.
goodnight103,It doesn’t warm you up.
goodnight103,Still it is the spot light that casts its beam encasing me in light.
goodnight103,Unlike the sun, the moon is delicate.
goodnight103,Without the star’s companionship the moon would look forlorn in its solitude.
goodnight103,The irony is the sun is a star and yet when it takes the time to face us, it is the only star we see.
goodnight103,Under a crescent moon, I feel alive.
goodnight103,Summer nights spent swimming in black water, sitting in front of a crackling fire, lying down on a fleece blanket making order of the cosmos, these are the things I like to do.
goodnight103,Today I had a thought.
goodnight103,We, people, are like flames.
goodnight103,People who do not dwell on the bad have lights that shine oh so bright.
goodnight103,As for others their flame may sputter or flicker.
goodnight103,They may long to be stamped out.
goodnight103,As a flame can light another flame, we should use this as example.
goodnight103,People need to be filled with light.
goodnight103,Some one who is depressed needs it so much more.
goodnight103,Take the time to share it with them so that we may all be light.
goodnight103,Relationships seem so hard when they end.
goodnight103,People nurse their broken hearts.
goodnight103,Take heed and comfort in my words.
goodnight103,Wrap them aroundyour shoulders like a blanket.
goodnight103,Life is a series of meetings and partings.
goodnight103,When love leaves us, realize yes it hurts and yes it is real, but the future will bring you something better.

goodnight97,
goodnight97,I have a filthy potty mouth that makes truck drives blush.
goodnight97,I think there’s something striking about a teeny lil’ thing like me when I open up my wee lil’ mouth and the cuss words just pour out like steam.
goodnight97,I like to be shocking.
goodnight97,I won the battle of swears when I was 12.
goodnight97,My parents separated and my dad moved out.
goodnight97,My mom, over powered by her 3 teenage kids just couldn’t seem to stop us from swearing.
goodnight97,My parents never swear.
goodnight97,I’ve heard my mom cuss once, exactly once.
goodnight97,Dinner would go “Hey bro, pass the fucking salt”.
goodnight97,His reply “Here you go you little cunt.” To which my mom would say “You guys are awful.” We’d just laugh and laugh.
goodnight97,Swears lose their meaning when they become adjectives and verbs.
goodnight97,After a certain point of hear “you’re so cute... until you open your mouth” you learn you are growing up.
goodnight97,Maybe it’s time to talk like one.
goodnight97,There’s this list of truly forbidden swears I just can’t bear to utter.
goodnight97,The #1.
goodnight97,No no word, the “N” word.
goodnight97,So derogatory I just can’t say it.
goodnight97,Not ever.
goodnight97,#2.
goodnight97,GD and #3.
goodnight97,JC.
goodnight97,It’s a respect thing.
goodnight97,#4.
goodnight97,Retard.
goodnight97,I hate this word with a passion.
goodnight97,Don’t mock the mentally challenged.
goodnight97,Not cool.
goodnight97,#5.
goodnight97,Fag.
goodnight97,Don’t mock gays.
goodnight97,Not cool.
goodnight97,Up North, nobody says the “n” word.
goodnight97,Nobody.
goodnight97,That word has fallen off the face of the planet.
goodnight97,Doesn’t matter if you’re white or black.
goodnight97,No one uses it.
goodnight97,Down here I hear black people say it all the time.
goodnight97,I know I probably have no right to say or think this, but it bugs me, people constantly saying the “n” word.
goodnight97,They think it’s funny.
goodnight97,I personally feel it’s disrespectful.
goodnight97,For all those people who fight racism and discrimination, hearing this word all day at work it’s a slap in the face.
goodnight97,That’s right.
goodnight97,I’m half white, half Hispanic and the “n” word really bothers me.
goodnight97,I stopped swearing so much when I had my kids.
goodnight97,Didn’t need for them to go off into the world with trash talk and toilet mouths.
goodnight97,Monkey see, monkey do.
goodnight97,So wouldn’t constant use of the “n” word keep it in circulation even with non blacks who have “no right” to say it?
goodnight97,I know it’s weird but it bugs me
goodnight97,
goodnight124,
goodnight124,Although I have a great number of opinions on the hot topics sweeping across the country, I usually keep my personal thoughts to myself.
goodnight124,When online or dealing with other people, I try to follow this method:
goodnight124,           T – is it true?
goodnight124,H – is it helpful?
goodnight124,I  – is it inspiring?
goodnight124,N – is it necessary?
goodnight124,K – is it kind?
goodnight124,When reviewing my mental check list if it appears not to follow within these guidelines, I try to stay tight lipped with my useless opinion.
goodnight124,I find that I avoid a lot petty arguments this way and don’t waste my energy on those who can’t see past their own egos.
goodnight124,Unfortunately, I feel as if a great amount of today’s society has lost site of humanity, compassion, and respect for each other.
goodnight124,We have grown into a large population of narcissists.
goodnight124,Of course this isn’t the case for every individual out there.
goodnight124,However all too often I see large scale examples of mob mentality.
goodnight124,We must learn not to be swayed as simple minded sheep.
goodnight124,As I mentioned in a previous post, I’ve been closely following the case of 2 year old Noah Chamberlin who ran away from his grandmother and sister during a nature walk on a warm January afternoon.
goodnight124,After an exhausting week long search, Noah was found, deceased.
goodnight124,There were many cold, wet nights and it’s very conceivable the poor child expired from exposure and hypothermia.
goodnight124,What made this news story particularly fascinating to me was the overwhelming amount of volunteers, search dogs, and technology used in a desperate attempt to find the boy.
goodnight124,All methods failed.
goodnight124,However, the area police refused to acknowledge that maybe there was more that meets the eye and that this could possible be anything more than an “accident”.
goodnight124,The police claim Noah’s family would never harm him and that they were a good, Christian family.
goodnight124,I went into my critical thinking mode... the statements made about this family irked me in so many ways.
goodnight124,Seriously?
goodnight124,Are Christians found to be impossible of committing crimes?
goodnight124,Inflicting child abuse?
goodnight124,Committing murder?
goodnight124,Is Christianity a defense used to prove some one innocent?
goodnight124,What if Noah was a black child?
goodnight124,Would the police still be persisting the family’s uninvolvement of the child’s disappearance?
goodnight124,Would the search still have been massive?
goodnight124,I honestly don’t think it would have been the same if Noah wasn’t white.
goodnight124,I’m sorry to state this and raise this point, but I truly feel the police would have been pointing fingers if Noah came from a black family, or a mexican family, etc.
goodnight124,I think race and religion has EVERYTHING to do with it.
goodnight124,White parents have harmed their children.
goodnight124,Christian parents have harmed their child.
goodnight124,Examples of child abuse, murder, and the like have been found in EVERY ethnic group, religion, economic status, across the globe.
goodnight124,No one categorized group is exempt.
goodnight124,Please realize, I’m not saying this family is guilty of lying to police to cover anything up.
goodnight124,I don’t know them.
goodnight124,I haven’t met them.
goodnight124,I was never a part of this nor am I an expert on the matter.
goodnight124,In fact, if anything I feel sorrow and pity for the family.
goodnight124,If this tragedy happened accidentally as stated, than I can only imagine the pain and heaviness in their hearts.
goodnight124,I hope that one day the wounds won’t sting so much.
goodnight124,I hope the agony doesn’t tear an innocent family apart.
goodnight124,Who am I to question their story?
goodnight124,I’m no one really.
goodnight124,I am simply an individual who doesn’t approve of some one using religion to proclaim innocence.
goodnight124,Maybe it’s because I am not a Christian that this bothers me so much and rubs me the wrong way.
goodnight124,I just don’t see how skin color, religion, and like makes one exempt from committing crimes against humanity or disregarding the welfare of another being.
goodnight124,Does me being Pagan mean that I would be scrutinized and judged to be guilty if I faced a similar crisis?
goodnight124,Would people assume because I’m pagan I must be capable of harming the very children I love and care for?
goodnight124,We live in a world with so much senseless violence.
goodnight124,A waitress was shot and killed at work because she asked a patron not to smoke in the establishment.
goodnight124,A good samaritan was shot and killed trying to help a man who’s car had gotten stuck in the snow.
goodnight124,Terrorist groups strike to kill as many people as possible.
goodnight124,Life is precious and so many twisted individuals take it upon themselves to end the live’s of others.
goodnight124,When we live in a world without peace, it’s hard to know just who is innocent and who is guilty.

goodnight98,Inanna
goodnight98,“Inanna is the Queen of Heaven and Earth”
goodnight98,Inanna is a Mesopotamian / Sumerian deity, a goddess.
goodnight98,She is one of the first Earthly Anunnaki offspring.
goodnight98,Some associate her with Istar or Isis, but neither of those figure heads are the reincarnation of Inanna.
goodnight98,Inanna is not a daughter of Adam.
goodnight98,She was a very passionate woman, although she always retained a youthful appearance.
goodnight98,She had a very complex, dynamic personality that ranged from sensuous lover to fierce warrior.
goodnight98,In ancient portrayals of her, she is pulled by lions on a chariot.
goodnight98,While many of the ancient deities earned the title “Mother Goddess”, Inanna did not although she was referred to as “Morning Star”.
goodnight98,She is also closely associated with resurrection and reincarnation for she was able to travel to the Underworld and than back to Earth.
goodnight98,It’s a fascinating, ancient myth.
goodnight98,In fact, mentions of Inanna go as far back to some of the first ever recorded word.
goodnight98,Inanna was powerful as well as lustful.
goodnight98,She conquered knowledge, reincarnation, amongst other sought powers.
goodnight98,She was a lover as well as a warrior and renowned for both qualities equally.

goodnight145,In the United States it is Thanksgiving today.
goodnight145,Even though I’m American this just isn’t one of my favorite holidays.
goodnight145,I hate squash and I’m not big on turkey either.
goodnight145,While I do appreciate the sentiment of taking a day or a moment to reflect upon what I am thankful for before a long cold winter sets in, I feel one should gratefully list these assets at the end of each and everyday for each day that we live is truly a gift.
goodnight145,The concept behind the first Thanksgiving is so removed from this modern age.
goodnight145,To me, celebrating it in a way that customs dictate seems to be hypocritical and condescending.
goodnight145,It would be one thing if the early Americans didn’t abuse and kill the Native Americans or if their culture and beliefs hadn’t been obliterated, but that is the true history between these cultures.
goodnight145,So celebrating Thanksgiving and ignoring the history seems like an ignorant joke to me.
goodnight145,I know people mean well, but maybe we should pick a different day for this type of celebration.
goodnight145,In this day and age Thanksgiving symbolizes the start of the count down to Christmas.
goodnight145,Its all to commercialized for my taste.
goodnight145,Having been brought up Roman Catholic I celebrate Christmas because it is expected and my kids enjoy participating in all the holiday events.
goodnight145,I feel like a traitor turning my back on my personal beliefs just to go with flow.
goodnight145,I think this is the year I will turn my back on Christmas and celebrate an older holiday instead.
goodnight145,C’mon Yule!
goodnight145,
goodnight129,
goodnight129,I miss the fellowship... it’s hard to explain and if you’re actually reading this I apologize.
goodnight129,It’s probably not something you’d be able to understand.
goodnight129,It’s just me giving into what most of society would assume to be a delusion.
goodnight129,I can try to explain the madness and the insanity, but at the end you’d just doubt me and that is something my heart can not take right now.
goodnight129,The easiest thing for me to be honest about is this – I’m an empath.
goodnight129,That means that I experience the feelings of others through a connective process (speech, touch, close relationships, etc.).
goodnight129,I feel their feelings as if they are my own.
goodnight129,I can not distinguish what is actually me or some one else.
goodnight129,Others near me might see me burst into tears or giggle which can occur at highly inappropriate times.
goodnight129,It happens when some one connected with me experiences a very powerful emotion.
goodnight129,On the day of the Paris terror attacks I was very unsettled.
goodnight129,I keep telling the man no one has the right to end someone else’s life.
goodnight129,I didn’t know what kept making me say that.
goodnight129,It didn’t pertain to anything going on in my life and yet I was scared, sad, and angry.
goodnight129,I found out that night about the attacks and when I calculated the time zone difference it was exactly when I had my “anxiety” attack.
goodnight129,My mood can effect the mood of others with no verbal or physical output.
goodnight129,My emotions leak into the air.
goodnight129,If I had a bad day at work everyone experiences my tension when I walk in my front door even if I don’t reflect my mood.
goodnight129,For the good and well being of those I love, it’s imperative that I always stay positive.
goodnight129,Sometimes people “hear” my thoughts.
goodnight129,They know the exact phrase I’ll think in my head even if I said nothing in reality.
goodnight129,I really despise this phenomenon.
goodnight129,My thoughts should be just for me especially if I never intended to vocally utter them.
goodnight129,I could go on and on about my peculiar quirks.
goodnight129,I use to belong to an online community connecting me to people like me.
goodnight129,There ended up being too much drama so I dropped it like a bad habit.
goodnight129,Days like today make me wish that I hadn’t.
goodnight129,I miss feeling like a drop in the oddball ocean.
goodnight129,In my isolation I feel like I stick out like a sore thumb.
goodnight129,I’m forced to keep this part of me hidden for fear of violent scrutiny.
goodnight129, 
goodnight129,
goodnight80,
goodnight80,I’m counting down the days.
goodnight80,Counting out of excitement.
goodnight80,Counting out of misery.
goodnight80,It’s disconcerting to be counting both for good and for bad.
goodnight80,Toothless has about a month left.
goodnight80,That’s just a guess based off of her veterinarian’s prognosis and from what I’ve read about spinal lymphoma on the internet.
goodnight80,In reality there is no expiration date.
goodnight80,In fact, I feel horrible inside for I’m the one calling the shots.
goodnight80,When the tumor eats away at her spinal cord and her hind legs are paralyzed, that’s our “sign” to euthanize.
goodnight80,Pretty shitty if you ask me.
goodnight80,Then there’s Tyrion.
goodnight80,Originally we were going to name him Ben, but not everyone in my house liked that name.
goodnight80,Why Tyrion?
goodnight80,In my house we are Game Of Thrones fans.
goodnight80,My favorite character is Tyrion.
goodnight80,I love his logic.
goodnight80,I love that even though he’s a Lannister, he’s got morals.
goodnight80,He has compassion.
goodnight80,In all honesty, I suspect him of being Tygaryen.
goodnight80,In the books he’s depicted of having one green eye and one purple eye – a Tygaryen trait.
goodnight80,Popular fan theory is that his mother was raped by the Mad King.
goodnight80,So I’m naming my kitten Tyrion.
goodnight80,He’s about 3 weeks now.
goodnight80,I have about 3 – 5 more weeks before I can bring him home.
goodnight80,I love his golden color and his little stripes.
goodnight80,Toothless is completely black.
goodnight80,Jake is almost all black.
goodnight80,Andy is black and white.
goodnight80,This kitten will help heal our hearts over sweet Toothless.
goodnight80,He’s not a replacement.
goodnight80,We were intending on having 4 cats.
goodnight80,From what I hear little Tyrion is a loud mouth.
goodnight80,I like vocal cats.
goodnight80,He’s just starting to walk.
goodnight80,Soon he will be home and running around playing with his big brothers.
goodnight80,
goodnight148,
goodnight148,I am a believer and user of pscionics.
goodnight148,In other words I am psychic to an extent.
goodnight148,My strongest talent is as an empath.
goodnight148,In other words, I connect and physically feel the emotions of people around me and people who I am strongly connected too.
goodnight148,I can see auras, not strongly though.
goodnight148,I wasn’t always able to see them.
goodnight148,This “trick” or talent came as I learned how to pull the energy force from others to me.
goodnight148,In a way, this is a form of physic vampirism... and while some may feel there is no such thing, let me just say it’s real.
goodnight148,One would be wise to take caution when dealing with such a person.
goodnight148,Your energy field is their food.
goodnight148,I effect the dreams of others.
goodnight148,These dreams feel entirely real to the dreamer.
goodnight148,Sometimes I think it was a manner of energy feeding, other times I realize it has a far deeper meaning: my inner soul shed bare longing to connect.
goodnight148,I’ve predicted the future.
goodnight148,Not when I wanted to, not when it counts.
goodnight148,I’ve never prevented a tragedy and I’ve never won the lottery.
goodnight148,Precognition isn’t something that I can call on at will, but it has happened.
goodnight148,I can communicate with others like me from a distance within my mind.
goodnight148,Its thrilling to actually call or talk to these people later and see that they did in fact,  share this experience.
goodnight148,I’m not much of a medium.
goodnight148,I can NOT talk to ghosts / spirits and RARELY do I see them.
goodnight148,I can however feel their energy and I can feel their emotions... it’s a very overwhelming experience.
goodnight148,There is no place for me in the bible.
goodnight148,By my very nature (creative,  independent, seeking truth)  I admit, I follow a left hand path.
goodnight148,God has no place for me.
goodnight148,I do not dwell on it.
goodnight148,My soul is immortal.
goodnight148,I have lived, died, and been reborn many many times.
goodnight148,I am a flawed, simple human – the same as you.
goodnight148,At one time life time and life times ago I was Inanna... which may have been something then, is now utterly insignificant.
goodnight148,I live each day in the hope to be great again.
goodnight148,After all, its not about the lives I have lived, it is about the here and now.
goodnight148,
goodnight110,
goodnight110,It’s getting late (for me anyways).
goodnight110,For once I’m sort of stumped on what to write.
goodnight110,Usually I can always think of some thing.
goodnight110,I feel an idea for a topic beginning to shake up in my mind.
goodnight110,I’m dyslexic.
goodnight110,If you’ve read my journal before you might have noticed a few grammatical errors.
goodnight110,Yeah, I’m the chick who can’t always type a coherent sentence, but in my head I do!
goodnight110,I also have a strong bad habit of leaving words out or substituting the wrong word for a word I had really meant to say.
goodnight110,If I focus really hard I can correct myself, but more often than not my brain just sees what it wants to see and I won’t notice my grammar breech at all.
goodnight110,I have a high iq despite my set back.
goodnight110,My level of “disability” is mainly effected when it comes to output I give (writing and speech) and not at all with input.
goodnight110,I can speed read.
goodnight110,I’ll read from the top of a page to the bottom with a quick diagonal nod of my head.
goodnight110,It’s extremely important to me to stay as sharp as possible.
goodnight110,I love to write.
goodnight110,I have notebooks upon notebooks with free flow poems and short stories I’ve never successfully managed to finish.
goodnight110,Reading is a way of life for me.
goodnight110,Reading inspires me.
goodnight110,Library trips in my household occur weekly.
goodnight110,We don’t have cable.
goodnight110,I’m proud to say that all 3 of my babies are book worms, especially Bobo.
goodnight110,The Man is the most avid, dedicated reader.
goodnight110,He’s always in the middle of a book.
goodnight110,I mix up numbers.
goodnight110,It’s easier for me to read a group of numbers and recite them than it does for me to repeat back a random grouping in sequential order.
goodnight110,I need a surgeons level of care and attention when I’m making a financial transaction.
goodnight110,In my head I know it, but something goes haywire when I need it to apply.
goodnight110,Don’t ask me for directions.
goodnight110,I have trouble with the concept of left and right.
goodnight110,It disorients me for some reason I can’t fathom.
goodnight110,The big irony is that I understand north, west, east and south perfectly.
goodnight110,I am no stranger to a map.
goodnight110,I never get lost, ever, even when I try to.
goodnight110,I have a very accurate internal compass.
goodnight110,In my head east, south, north, and west are 2 D while left and right are 3 D and make my head spin.
goodnight110,I want to write more about this, but I’m getting pretty sleepy... good night
goodnight110,
goodnight123,
goodnight123,The girls had a sleep over with their grandpa this week.
goodnight123,Deedee came back with a new pair of boots.
goodnight123,It might not seem like it at first glance, but Deedee is sort of spoiled.
goodnight123,I’m not complaining that she gets extra time at her grandparent’s house, or that they take her out for almost every meal, or even that they buy her nice things.
goodnight123,It’s just that when it comes to Deedee one cannot help, but give her a monster or a chocolate treat.
goodnight123,I can easily say no to Snoochie and Bobo, but resisting Deedee isn’t so easy.
goodnight123,While we were enjoying time with just Bobo we took him to El Pablano.
goodnight123,The three of us had a great time.
goodnight123,I also treasure those moments when I can give 100% of my attention and affection to just one of the three.
goodnight123,Bobo, the man, and me had a great time going out for dinner (despite the fact we couldn’t have our giant punch bowl margaritas since Bobo was with us).
goodnight123,I binge watched a show call Vikings this week end.
goodnight123,I love this show.
goodnight123,It’s epic.
goodnight123,The fact that the Vikings were Pagan, believe in signs and psychics, and are brutal pillaging warriors totally enthralled me.
goodnight123,The man’s bloodline comes from the Scottish highlands and I swear he has ancient Viking blood in him (we thought this for years, long before this show came along).
goodnight123,I worked a lot this weekend (but I did get to enjoy Saturday off).
goodnight123,Friday night we closed early because of the snow storm, so unfortunately I lost an hour.
goodnight123,Yesterday was my long shift.
goodnight123,My next day off is Thursday, which seems so far away.
goodnight123,I’ve been more focused at work.
goodnight123,I’m paying sharp attention to all those little details.
goodnight123,I like being able to hold my own.
goodnight123,The Man took me shopping for new pants.
goodnight123,It’s kind of bitter sweet.
goodnight123,Yes, I need new clothes.
goodnight123,I squeeze into pants that are way too small.
goodnight123,I hate the shape it gives me.
goodnight123,Muffin top.
goodnight123,Gross.
goodnight123,I have to admit, I loved being so teensy that my daughters’ pants were too big for me.
goodnight123,Now I’ve been forced to borrow them just so I can fit comfortably into something.
goodnight123,I may never get my old size back, but I’m not giving up.
goodnight123,Yes, I’m not fat, but I am not satisfied with my shape and tone.
goodnight123,It’s been too cold to walk outside so following my “diet” is going to be crucial for the last few winter months.
goodnight123,
goodnight81,
goodnight81,If I ran into you, I’d try not to look at you.
goodnight81,I’d just keep going about my business and give you that glare of mine that makes you feel like I’m looking right through you.
goodnight81,It’s not that you aren’t worth my time of day.
goodnight81,Simply put... I’ve moved on.
goodnight81,Bet you didn’t expect that out of me?
goodnight81,Honestly what’s the point of even thinking about you and me?
goodnight81,There’s literally nothing there.
goodnight81,You were just the first one to know it.
goodnight81,All you were and are to me, is ideal, an addiction, a fixation.
goodnight81,I guess it took everything out of me to realize that the person I thought I could love forever was done.
goodnight81,I get it.
goodnight81,I suck.
goodnight81,I was wrong.
goodnight81,No room in you for forgiveness.
goodnight81,My worst error of all, was that I couldn’t let you go.
goodnight81,Sorry for thinking the world of you.
goodnight81,Shoulda known better, but I was young.
goodnight81,Funny thing is I use to imagine bumping into you again.
goodnight81,Let you see how different I am.
goodnight81,Play coy.
goodnight81,Little dirty girl all grown up.
goodnight81,Fantasy is futile and I’ve no time for your ghost.
goodnight81,So goodbye.
goodnight81,Let your name crumble into the wind.
goodnight81,I hope I never see you again.
goodnight81,No hard feelings, my first love.
goodnight81,I’m in a good place and I don’t like complications.
goodnight81,I’m done testing people to the brink of their devotion.
goodnight81,I have something pure, something unconditional, something better than you.
goodnight81,
goodnight126,
goodnight126,It’s time I buckle down and remember the distinct separation of church and state.
goodnight126,Well, in my case it is more of a matter personal life verse work relationships.
goodnight126,A comment flew off the tongue of a co-worker, a highly inappropriate comment.
goodnight126,I suppose I should divulge its content, but I’m reluctant.
goodnight126,I’ve spent 24 hours going back and forth between stewing over it and actively ignoring it.
goodnight126,Everyone will judge so the only judgement that holds water is my own.
goodnight126,However, I’d rather not have rumors fly around about me and my name dragged through the mud.
goodnight126,This is, after all, a huge reason I chose to move so far a way in order to give myself a fresh start.
goodnight126,So in this case the proper course of action is to be a busy bee, keep to myself, and hold my tongue.
goodnight126,Certainly there is no need in this instance for confrontation or retaliation.
goodnight126,To move past this I must hold my head high and show my worth.
goodnight126,Respect is earned.
goodnight126,Time for me to buckle down, ignore personal slights, work hard, and speak with love for others.
goodnight126,Positivity can and shall be contagious.
goodnight126,#keepingitstraight 
goodnight126,On the home front... I’ve caught The Man’s cold.
goodnight126,Yuck.
goodnight126,At least I have an excuse to be lazy for a day or two.

goodnight131,
goodnight131,I’ve never actually sat down and wrote my own bucket list.
goodnight131,Sure, I dream big.
goodnight131,There’s places I want to travel to, things I want to have.
goodnight131,So here it goes.
goodnight131,My bucket list.

goodnight131,I want a paranormal tour of the Earth.
goodnight131,Here in the states I especially want to go to New Orleans, Waverly Hills, The outer island’s of South Carolina, The Cecil hotel, and Myrtle’s plantation.
goodnight131,Sites out of the states would include poveglia (plague island), Pompeii, Venice (in general), Leap Castle (and other structures involved with the Hellfire Club – so Ireland), Hoia Baciu Forest in Romania (specifically, the clearing), and southern Iraq due to it being where it was once known as Sumeria & Mesopotamia.

goodnight134,
goodnight134,I grew up in an old, big, red house.
goodnight134,It had been my home since the minute my parents brought me home from the hospital.
goodnight134,The horse hair plastered walls and wooden beams hold the precious memories of my infancy.
goodnight134,My mother would sit in her rocking chair and nurse me.
goodnight134,I’m getting to old to comprehend just how those earlier years went.
goodnight134,I imagine baths in the kitchen sink, sleeping soundly in the nursery, my mom pacing around trying to sooth a swaddled infant me.
goodnight134,I grew up knowing there was more to the house than what meets the eye.
goodnight134,I always sensed that not only was something not quite right, but even when I was alone, I wasn’t REALLY alone.
goodnight134,Certain spots in the house chilled me to the bone.
goodnight134,One spot that particularly scared me was the landing on the stair well between the 1st and 2nd floor.
goodnight134,I never walked up and down those stairs.
goodnight134,I always ran up them, jumped down them, or slid down the banister.
goodnight134,Those stairs stirred a feeling of sheer terror in me.
goodnight134,They felt sinister.
goodnight134,Everyone has got a ghost story about my old house.
goodnight134,I have a whole life time’s worth that I could easily write a novel dedicated to the paranormal activity that occurred within those walls.
goodnight134,Some stories scared the daylight out of me.
goodnight134,Some make me go “hmmm”, but one story in particular simply brings a smile to my face.
goodnight134,My sister use to tell me that a ghost lived in her bedroom.
goodnight134,“It’s an old lady,” she’d tell me.
goodnight134,“She sits in mom’s old rocking chair by the window.
goodnight134,She’s a nice old lady ghost.
goodnight134,She protects me from the bad ghosts.” I believed my sister.
goodnight134,I never, ever, not once SAW the old lady, but I could certainly feel her.
goodnight134,Her essence was sad, but protective.
goodnight134,Sometimes I had friends over.
goodnight134,After they’d return from using the second floor bath (which was 2 rooms a way from my sister’s bedroom) they’d remark to me: “I didn’t know your grandmother lives with you.” Wait... what?
goodnight134,Neither of my grandmothers lived with us.
goodnight134,In fact they rarely even visited that house.
goodnight134,Over the years people who visited my old, red house FREQUENTLY reported seeing an elderly lady sitting in the rocking chair in my sister’s bedroom.
goodnight134,They innocently assumed that this was a real person and probably a relative of mine.
goodnight134,My friends were mystified when I’d lead them right back up stairs and prove that there was in fact, no one in that room.
goodnight134,Eventually my mom sold the house.
goodnight134,I grew up.
goodnight134,I started a family of my own.
goodnight134,I still thought of the spirits that inhibited my old house from time to time, but only the ones that really scared me.
goodnight134,One day I was having a talk with my daughter.
goodnight134,She’s very driven to the paranormal.
goodnight134,I was trying to encourage her not to mess with dangerous spirits.
goodnight134,Our conversation led us to talking about guardian angels.
goodnight134,“Did you know that I can see your guardian angel?” She confided in me.
goodnight134,Curious, I pressed her to give me a description of my “angel”.
goodnight134,What my daughter said shocked me.
goodnight134,“She’s old.
goodnight134,She has very grey hair and it’s pulled back into a bun, but she has fly-a-ways on top of her forehead.
goodnight134,She wears a ruffled, ivory, button up blouse, and a long dark skirt.
goodnight134,The outfit is complete with a pair of sturdy, black, pointed, heeled boots.” As my daughter described this so called angel the hair on my arms began to stand up.
goodnight134,I’ve heard this description before ... many years ago when I was a teenager.
goodnight134,“She sits in a rocking chair near a window in a room with blue flowered wallpaper.” Okay, now I’m thoroughly creeped out.
goodnight134,My daughter was describing my sister’s old bedroom to me.
goodnight134,It was a room my daughter has never seen with her own eyes or even in a picture.
goodnight134,“The old lady is sad, but she loves you.” Explained my daughter.
goodnight134,“She’s watched over you since you were born and she tries to keep you safe.” Isn’t that what a guardian angel does?
goodnight134,I thought about me, as an infant and a sweet old lady ghost seeing me, watching me.
goodnight134,I thought about her maternal instincts and what it might have meant for her to be dead, and yet care for a living child.
goodnight134,Senses of love and responsibility never left her, not even in death.
goodnight134,So, here I am, the infant all grown up and I feel proud to say that I have a ghost who watches over me.
goodnight134,
goodnight105,
goodnight105,I got a new book from the library today and it’s written by an author I don’t know.
goodnight105,Usually when I pick a book to cuddle up with I stick to authors I know and enjoy.
goodnight105,Jim Butcher, James Patterson, Dan Brown, Anne Rice, J.K. Rowling, V.C.
goodnight105,Andrews, Stephen King have all written books that I immensely enjoyed.
goodnight105,The book I’m about to start is “When We Were God’s” a novel of Cleopatra by Colin Falcorner.
goodnight105,I’m a big history buff especially when it comes to ancient Egypt, Sumeria, and Mesopotamia.
goodnight105,I love how the rulers became gods and goddesses forever engrained with time and sand.
goodnight105,I’m not sure if this book will be an accurate depiction of the authentic life of Cleopatra, but I have a healthy imagination to be entertained regardless.
goodnight105,What I’d really love to find is books about the Anunnaki gods and specifically, Inanna.
goodnight105,My soul pulls so strongly to her.
goodnight105,It’s beyond fascination.
goodnight105,It’s obsession.
goodnight105,I love how her traits resemble me.
goodnight105,I love her lust for war or love.
goodnight105,My local library doesn’t carry any pagan books never mind the anything referencing the ancient anunnaki dynasty.
goodnight105,It’s a shame.
goodnight105,I’ll need to use amazon and google if I want that type of literature.
goodnight105,I suppose I’ll make do reading about Cleopatra.
goodnight105,A good story can inspire dreams larger than the stars.
goodnight105,
goodnight135,
goodnight135,I’ve got the winter blues.
goodnight135,Life lately has been limited to work, running errands, watching a lil’ bit of tv, and house work.
goodnight135,My high points have been going out to eat with The Man at our favourite restaurant (well, my favourite restaurant) and the new kitty scape we purchased for the boys.
goodnight135,That’s been it.
goodnight135,Kind of lame and not exactly living it up if you ask me.
goodnight135,I’ve got Saturday off and The Man usually has Saturdays off.
goodnight135,The weather has been fairly mild lately.
goodnight135,I didn’t even need a jacket today.
goodnight135,The gears in my head are moving, forming a plan...
goodnight135,Last Summer we took the chillens on an Epic Hike Day.
goodnight135,We hiked 2 mountains and made it 1/2 way up a third when Deedee decided she’d had enough.
goodnight135,We never made it to the top of Table Rock Mountain.
goodnight135,I heard the view is breath taking.
goodnight135,I for one, was in love with the trail we were on.
goodnight135,The picture in this blog is from Blue Moutain Ridge and in the distance is Table Rock.
goodnight135,All fall and this winter The Man and I keep talking about going back and finishing what we started.
goodnight135,Picnic lunch on the top of a Mountain, taking in the view – sounds like my ideal date!
goodnight135,I plan on bringing the idea up tomorrow when I see The Man.
goodnight135,He’s been feeling sick lately and can’t seem to shake off some sort of bug.
goodnight135,He may not be up for it.
goodnight135,I’m crossing my fingers.
goodnight135,I need a day spent with my feet on the Earth, surrounded by trees and sky.
goodnight135,I need the exercise.
goodnight135,I need this moment!
goodnight135,It’s just the thing to cure my winter blues.
goodnight135,
goodnight82,
goodnight82,This week is all highs.
goodnight82,I’m up above the clouds in disbelief that my life has taken such a huge turn for the better.
goodnight82,I use to think suicide was beginning to look like an attractive option.
goodnight82,Now I’m glad I that I refused to give up.
goodnight82,I didn’t feel like I had anything to live for, but I didn’t want my kids growing up thinking that I didn’t love and care about them enough to try living for just a bit more.
goodnight82,I’ve been working out almost every day.
goodnight82,I’ve taken a shine to Zumba (at home, on my wii).
goodnight82,I hate working out in public.
goodnight82,I’m very stiff and rigid.
goodnight82,I don’t have fluid nor graceful movements.
goodnight82,I rarely gesture.
goodnight82,So while I love dancing and moving my body in motions that feel foreign I am rather self conscious about it.
goodnight82,In private settings I could care less.
goodnight82,I did a few routines last night.
goodnight82,The Man joined me.
goodnight82,It seemed like more of a game to us than a work out.
goodnight82,Afterwards he sat and talked with me a bit.
goodnight82,Long story short he’s concerned about his health and his weight.
goodnight82,He’s worried about diabetes.
goodnight82,It’s in his family.
goodnight82,It’s not a fate he wants.
goodnight82,Luckily he can do something about it.
goodnight82,So the good news is I have an exercise buddy.
goodnight82,We’re in this together.
goodnight82,With our work schedules being crazy and opposing lately we’ve had trouble sharing the family jeep.
goodnight82,I spend about an extra 2 hours of my day driving to and from The Man’s job so that I can get to mine.
goodnight82,Today, we solved the problem.
goodnight82,I am now the proud owner of a Ford Mustang.
goodnight82,It’s not the newest nor the best model there is, but the price was definitely right.
goodnight82,I’m not sure which one of us likes it more.
goodnight82,The best part is: it’s a standard!!!
goodnight82,I love driving stick.
goodnight82,If I ended my life a few bad years ago I would miss being the proud owner of a mustang.
goodnight82,I’d miss getting the chance to make things right with the man.
goodnight82,I’d miss the kittens who I’d never own and yet give me so much love.
goodnight82,I’d miss watching my kids grow.
goodnight82,Time is given.
goodnight82,You can’t buy it.
goodnight82,You can give it up, but then you’re the one missing out. 
goodnight82,

goodnight121,Dreams are supposed to be the windows to our subconscious.
goodnight121,If you pay attention dreams can reveal our inner fears, hearts desires, and even details of our lives we failed to see with our eyes open.
goodnight121,Dreams can mean so many things.
goodnight121,All too often some one tells me about their dreams, their nightmares.
goodnight121,Some dreams are scary, others profound, and some make no sense what so ever.
goodnight121,Regardless, I can’t help but feel left out.
goodnight121,I’ve been told that everyone who sleeps dreams.
goodnight121,That isn’t a very useful fact.
goodnight121,Whether I dream or not I almost ALWAYS can not remember them.
goodnight121,After I slip away from awareness, it just goes black.
goodnight121,One second I am awake, then asleep, next thing I know I am groggy, but waking up.
goodnight121,I am 33 and I can recall only about 20 dreams or so and those were very prophetic and symbolic.
goodnight121,When I meditate, sometimes I have a lucid dream, but that’s a very different thing.
goodnight121,A strange thing does happen though... sometimes while I’m groggy I willl get a vibe about some one I know or even a place.
goodnight121,An example would be that sometimes while still groggy I’ll think of a co worker and an emotion attached to them.
goodnight121,Then when I see that person they will tell me they dreamed of me and the tone and type of the dream will be whatever emotion I felt.
goodnight121,Its unnerving,  but by this point I am use to it and I control it.
goodnight121,The rabbit hole gets deeper.
goodnight121,I am in full control of these dream visits.
goodnight121,If I focus on a person or a place, that person will tell me I visited them in a dream that felt extremely real.
goodnight121,If I visit a location after I’ve dreamt it I can tell you weird details (like what’s hidden in a dresser drawer if I checked it out in a dream) and I can physically validate these details once a wake.
goodnight121,Its weird, I know...
goodnight121,So I may not dream in a typical sense, but my brain is definitely up to something while I sleep.  
goodnight121,

goodnight120,From high above the water crashes down
goodnight120,Dampened skin, hearts pounding heavy
goodnight120,In the dark cave, behind the water fall
goodnight120,Your arms wrapped my frame
goodnight120,It’s time say good bye
goodnight120,This is the only way
goodnight120,One soul has been claimed
goodnight120,And I choose it to be you
goodnight120,The moment is at hand
goodnight120,In the dark Ba swings his sword
goodnight120,You never saw it coming
goodnight120,I kiss at gash as the blood runs down
goodnight120,You were my ultimate sacrifice 
goodnight120,I stare into your eyes
goodnight120,In that moment as you take your last breath
goodnight120,You have a revelation as the light shines bright, calling you home
goodnight120,Love and Hate is the same
goodnight120,In the eyes of Inanna
goodnight120, 
goodnight120,For centuries I have paid the price for your death
goodnight120,Always missing you, always longing
goodnight120,Never able to trust again
goodnight120,I hear your call in the wind
goodnight120,I taste your kisses in the rain
goodnight120,I can’t find you my love
goodnight120,I’m paying the price
goodnight120,In this immortality, I am reborn
goodnight120,Only to be haunted by the ghost of you
goodnight120,

goodnight133,
goodnight133,Last night J’s cousin messaged him to comment on how Deedee seems like such a “dark” kid and how her FB page is filled with posts about emo / goth bands and creepy pasta stuff.
goodnight133,“What the heck happened to her?!?
goodnight133,!”
goodnight133,Rash judgement of Deedee drives me up a wall.
goodnight133,Yes, she likes to wear dark colors.
goodnight133,Yes, she listens to emo music.
goodnight133,Yes, she’s a horror movie buff.
goodnight133,What happened?
goodnight133,Nothing.
goodnight133,She’s 14.
goodnight133,If said cousin had paid any attention to Deedee while we lived closer he might have noticed she has Asperger’s Syndrome.
goodnight133,She separates herself from her peers.
goodnight133,When she takes up a hobby, she’s obsessive about it.
goodnight133,She has ALWAYS been this way.
goodnight133,When she was 10, I took her and my other 2 babies to Disney World.
goodnight133,Deedee tried to pack all of her stuff by herself.
goodnight133,When I double checked her suitcase, I discovered that every article of clothing she packed was BLACK!
goodnight133,I’ve tried to get her to wear a more colorful wardrobe and she clearly doesn’t want to.
goodnight133,She’s 14.
goodnight133,It’s a phase.
goodnight133,When she stopped listening to Katie Perry and Selena Gomez and pronounced her love for “My Chemical Romance”, I listened to her new favorite bands.
goodnight133,My opinion: The lyrics are inspiring.
goodnight133,I can see how an isolated teenager can relate to it.
goodnight133,There’s really nothing demonic about it.
goodnight133,Her favorite movies are “The Nightmare Before Christmas”, “Coraline”, and “Corpse Bride”.
goodnight133,Not to mention she likes an assortment of seemingly strange Japanese anime movies.
goodnight133,Her favorite store at the mall is “Hot Topic”.
goodnight133,*sigh*
goodnight133,At her school the other kids listen to rap.
goodnight133,They like Wayne and Drake.
goodnight133,They listen to songs that talk about getting drunk, gang violence, and sex.
goodnight133,This type of music, to me, encourages violence, underage drinking, and serious skank activity.
goodnight133,Some of her classmates drink, smoke, smoke pot.
goodnight133,Most of them aren’t virgins.
goodnight133,Deedee comes from a generation that is growing up too fast for ones so young.
goodnight133,Deedee doesn’t drink.
goodnight133,She doesn’t smoke.
goodnight133,The closet thing to sex she’s experienced is that she kissed a boy ONCE.
goodnight133,She chooses her friends wisely.
goodnight133,Honestly, if said cousin thinks she’s “too emo” than what would he prefer?
goodnight133,She’s too old for barbies and my little pony.
goodnight133,Would he feel better if she was posting selfies while scantily dressed, trying to attract the wrong kind of attention?
goodnight133,Would he prefer a regressed 14 year old posting pictures of kittens and unicorns?
goodnight133,For crying out loud, she’s growing up.
goodnight133,She’s rearranging her looks, she’s discovering her identity.
goodnight133,I also feel the need to mention who is said cousin to judge her?
goodnight133,He’s not a dad.
goodnight133,Supposedly he has a kid, who he has never met nor supported for a single second in the child’s life.
goodnight133,Said cousin is a bar scene alcoholic who picks up the “easiest” or drunkest girls and takes them home for a one nighter.
goodnight133,He’s never been a role model to any child in his extended family.
goodnight133,He should worry about himself instead of a 14 year old autism spectrum girl who is very passionate about her hobbies.
goodnight133,If you ask me, Deedee is a rare gem.
goodnight133,She reads H.P.
goodnight133,Lovecraft and manga.
goodnight133,She likes going to the library.
goodnight133,She’s insistent that she needs to be in ALL honors classes next year when she goes to high school.
goodnight133,She’s adamant about going to college.
goodnight133,I never have to tell her to do her homework.
goodnight133,I rarely ever have to correct her.
goodnight133,She listens to her teachers, her dad, and me.
goodnight133,She’s never had a detention.
goodnight133,She’s such a GREAT kid it’s to the point where she’s earned the right to wear what she wants (band tee shirts and black skinny jeans).
goodnight133,She’s earned the right to listen to what she wants.
goodnight133,I can’t force her to be some one she’s not just because she’s a “dark” kid.
goodnight133,And if she appears a little dark and stormy, so what?
goodnight133,She’s been betrayed by adults that she trusted.
goodnight133,Said cousin use to encourage her dad to drink and be more involved in his metal band than his kids (not that case anymore – her father’s 1st priority is his offspring).
goodnight133,Funny how he doesn’t see how his own hand set this course for her.
goodnight133,Deedee hadn’t had the most stable, supportive, peachy upbringing despite how deeply loved she is.
goodnight133,My point is, she’s amazing.
goodnight133,If said cousin actually bothered to TALK to her before he judged her by her FB shares, maybe he’d realize that her darkness is an excuse to push her peers away due to her crippling social anxiety and that underneath the music and clothes, Deedee has a loving, beautiful soul.
goodnight133,
goodnight102,
goodnight102,I proudly live in a household void of cable tv.
goodnight102,We do watch movies, have video game systems, and have some technology available at our finger tips.
goodnight102,I like to binge watch various tv series when I feel the longing to be lazy.
goodnight102,My last great thriller was Vikings.
goodnight102,Currently I’ve taken a shine to American Horror Story – Freak Show.
goodnight102,Admittedly, it isn’t for everyone.
goodnight102,I have a gravitational pull towards the macabre so it right up my alley.
goodnight102,I’ve watched most of the other seasons.
goodnight102,I’ve seen all of Murder House, most of Asylum, and some of Coven.
goodnight102,Thoroughly engrossed in Freak Show, making connections to the past seasons, I started having some thoughts.
goodnight102,Our history, as humans (not limited any one country) has dark secrets tucked away.
goodnight102,We use to incarcerate people who suffered from mental health issues, mental retardation, physical deformities, or even people who had the unfortunate luck to be poverty stricken.
goodnight102,Was it right?
goodnight102,Morally, on an individual basis absolutely not.
goodnight102,Did it help society?
goodnight102,Shockingly the answer might be maybe.
goodnight102,I started to make all sorts of connections.
goodnight102,It’s a daily habit for me to read the news daily.
goodnight102,My heart shatters while I read stories of violent crimes, rising drug use, a revolving door prison system, child abuse, and so on.
goodnight102,It seems like once a day I come across an article where some one committed a murder suicide and selfishly ended some one else’s life in addition to their own.
goodnight102,Are we expressing this hideous behavior on a larger scale than back in the days of out casting and institutionalizing?
goodnight102,It’s that where most of this stems from?
goodnight102,Are we experiencing a huge deficit of treating mental health?
goodnight102,We can’t go back to the old system even if my theory is correct.
goodnight102,To dump our special needs and disabled neighbors and family members off like a bag of trash is cruel as it gets.
goodnight102,Nobody deserves that fate, especially those who are innocent.
goodnight102,I don’t have the answers on how to help society’s growing number of sociopaths and deviants, but throwing out the whole bushel of perfectly good apples just because there was one rotten one comes at too high of a cause.
goodnight102,I don’t even think these people were locked away for the purpose of protecting the greater good or to get the help and care that they needed.
goodnight102,Sadly I think they were subjected to imprisonment so we would be more of a cookie cutter society.
goodnight102,We could go on with our lives, pretending they didnt exist.
goodnight102,It’s a sad part of our history.
goodnight102, 
goodnight102,
goodnight137,
goodnight137,I’ve read so many other people’s journals and I can literally feel their sorrow, anxiety, anger, emptiness, etc.
goodnight137,It’s a weird experience.
goodnight137,Then again, I’m weird.
goodnight137,This week at work has been hectic.
goodnight137,I make it through my shifts with ease though.
goodnight137,Ever since I experienced my latest awakening, I’ve been more in tune with the others around me.
goodnight137,I don’t take slights personally.
goodnight137,I accept and appropriate constructive criticism and try to gain from it.
goodnight137,I’m even able to give my co-workers a glimpse at big boss they never noticed.
goodnight137,He isn’t bad, I told them.
goodnight137,He’s stressed and pressured.
goodnight137,He goes about things in an “angry panicked” manner, but he means well.
goodnight137,A thought I’ve been having lately is related to telepathy.
goodnight137,I wonder how many people experience this and do not realize that they indeed are picking up on some one else’s emotions and thoughts – all without words.
goodnight137,In a sense if more people had this extra sense, humanity would eventually begin to a resemble a collective hive colony like ants or bees.
goodnight137,What would that do in regards to violent world conflicts?
goodnight137,Religious genocide?
goodnight137,Territorial disputes?
goodnight137,I’m sure not every problem would simply evaporate if humans could think as one collective unit, but I think globally we would have more harmony in our lives.
goodnight137,We would care more for each other.
goodnight137,We would work as the ultimate team.
goodnight137,We’d have the same goals.
goodnight137,With those thoughts in mind, if we did indeed share a collective conscious would we be superior to those who do not (as in most people alive today)?
goodnight137,What would be some of the downfalls?
goodnight137,Surely loss of individually would be at stake, but to me the pro’s outweigh the cons.
goodnight137,I’ve heard “reports” (and I mean report loosely) that alien civilizations communicate through telepathy and their society uses a collective conscious.
goodnight137,Is that why they “seem” more advanced than us?
goodnight137,So those are my thoughts tonight.
goodnight137,My phone (and internet) will be off from 12 am today straight through Monday.
goodnight137,I could refill, but I rather stick to my budget schedule.
goodnight137,I haven’t checked the cycle, but tonight it sure seems like it’s a full moon.
goodnight137,Guests were at their worst.
goodnight137,Screaming, swearing, making a fuss – they didn’t treat us like we’re humans too and we matter.
goodnight137,There is nothing wrong with standing up, being strong, speaking your mind, and such.
goodnight137,However, just remember to treat every one as an equal.
goodnight137,NO ONE is more important than anyone else.
goodnight137,We all matter.
goodnight137,Every life that lives and breaths matters.
goodnight137,Good night 
goodnight137,
goodnight96,
goodnight96,I’m in love... yet again.
goodnight96,I’m also slowly becoming a crazy cat lady.
goodnight96,You know what?
goodnight96,I don’t care.
goodnight96,Sure one more cat means more food, more liter, and more cleaning.
goodnight96,To me the reward exceeds all of this.
goodnight96,I should promise myself right here, right now that we have enough fur babies in this house.
goodnight96,Okay here goes.
goodnight96,I proclaim that this sweet guy is the LAST kitten I’m adopting... for now.
goodnight96,If tragedy strikes one or the kids move out with their cats only then may I get another.
goodnight96,I can not wait.
goodnight96,Little Ben is only two weeks old and just opened his eyes.
goodnight96,It’ll be another 4 – 6 weeks before I can bring him home.
goodnight96,I have a thing about making sure my pets were given adequate time with their mother.
goodnight96,Wean them too soon and you may get a fur baby with a less than desirable disposition.
goodnight96,Since I have kids it’s important that we do all we can to ensure a happy, confident kitty.
goodnight96,This morning the concept of getting another cat was the furthest thing from my mind... than I went to work.
goodnight96,My sweet co-worker and I were talking about cats and she mentioned how her cat just had kittens.
goodnight96,I saw a picture and well I’m sucker for teensy paws.
goodnight96,There was one and only one obstacle that stood in the way.
goodnight96,My loving partner would surely try to bring me softly back to reality.
goodnight96,So I waged war.
goodnight96,I sent him a picture of Ben and asked “Can I have him?”.
goodnight96,The response was music to my ears.
goodnight96,“I just can’t say no to you”.
goodnight96,As much as The Man probably meant that, what I think he really meant was “I can’t say no to teeny lil’ paws.”
goodnight96,
goodnight109,
goodnight109,I am always where I am supposed to be.
goodnight109,That may not be where I think I should be.
goodnight109,It also may not be where you think I should be.
goodnight109,Despite all odds, my location is always perfect.
goodnight109,Do you know why that is?
goodnight109,I do.
goodnight109,It’s destiny.
goodnight109,Not all souls who wander are lost.
goodnight109,The Gaelic saying applies to me.
goodnight109,My soul is that of an eager adventurer always in search of something new to see.
goodnight109,My eyes take in the sights as if I were a plant soaking in the dew.
goodnight109,I prefer forest to beach, beach to city, but any place is as good as any to wander.
goodnight109,I drive by ransacked, abandoned dwellings and I wonder “what’s the story”?
goodnight109,I can feel the presence of the past.
goodnight109,Every place has its own mood.
goodnight109,I love the smell of sun beams through windows.
goodnight109,I love the smell of water running over smoothed rocks.
goodnight109,My senses are easily contented.
goodnight109,When I was 14 or so my mother and I drove from Massachusetts to New Jersey.
goodnight109,On the returning trip home, the map flew out the window (this was the age before GPS and cell phones).
goodnight109,My mother panicked.
goodnight109,To her being lost is like a death sentence.
goodnight109,It’s a source of anxiety.
goodnight109,To me, it’s simply a matter of refocusing on which way to go.
goodnight109,The Earth is only so big after all.
goodnight109,What’s the matter with getting a little side tracked.
goodnight109,I don’t remember how I did it exactly, but I picked highways that felt right.
goodnight109,I hadn’t traveled that route ever before, but using my stellar internal compass I navigated us home.
goodnight109,My mother was grateful and stunned.
goodnight109,So where ever I may go, I am never really lost because at that exact moment I’m exactly where I need to be. 
goodnight109,
goodnight0,
goodnight0,Which i am having mixed feelings about.
goodnight0,Don’t get me wrong, Chipotle is a great place to work...........if you’re 17.
goodnight0,If you’re new to the working world and haven’t had any experience with truly shitty and soul crushing human garbage bags (aka customers), then you’re ready to work there.
goodnight0,But when you’re almost 26, have been working in the retail industry for 10 years, have cried (often) because you feel like scrubbing human urine and feces off the floor is what you’re worth has been reduced to, or don’t feel like being patronized by snooty teenagers who think they’re gods gift to the world because they work at chipotle, then no, this work is not for you.
goodnight0,I just feel like I’ve paid my dues in the customer service industry.
goodnight0,I’ve done the song and dance of “you brought in an expired coupon and are being incredibly rude to a minimum wage employee?
goodnight0,Absolutely I can help you!
goodnight0,I’m here to serve you and whatever hostility you bring with a fucking smile on my face.
goodnight0,Let ME apologize for YOUR rudeness, it’s all my fault, afterall.
goodnight0,What do i know?
goodnight0,i’m a lowly employee, you’re the customer, and therefore a god in my eyes!
goodnight0,!” and I’m 100% over it.
goodnight0,so yeah.
goodnight0,that’s that.
goodnight0,on the other hand, the money was really nice.
goodnight0,and the people (mostly) were pretty cool.
goodnight0,But I just can’t deal anymore.
goodnight0,I really can’t.
goodnight0,so that’s that.
goodnight0,Plus, now I can actually work on my schoolwork.
goodnight0,Speaking of which, SPRING BREEEEAAAAK FOOOL!
goodnight0,yessss.
goodnight0,so happy.
goodnight0,the only sucky thing about it is I think I’m getting sick because I kissed oscar and he’s super sick.
goodnight0,but.
goodnight0,whatebs.
goodnight0,I wasn’t planning on doing shit this spring break anyway.
goodnight0,so if I get sick, that’s just another excuse to do just that.
goodnight0,And now to masturbate and go to sleep!
goodnight0,
goodnight0,
