goodnight322,Despite all the support I got from them.
goodnight322,Although I know they are good, I feel like I still owe them a lot including my sister and grand mom too.
goodnight322,This is the one of the reasons that I want to be success and give them back more than I received.
goodnight322,I just need to keep try and try to get things I want and get there where I want to be.
goodnight322,Yes, I gotta be more smart and work more harder cause I’m not even close yet.
goodnight322,I will never give up and one day I will get all of them!

goodnight386,who went to army with me and studying at Atlanta for Masters.
goodnight386,We talked about life in   general, career, school, family, future and marriage.

goodnight386,We both are still trying to move forward to get to the better place on our career and better place on out life.
goodnight386,Kind of feel like I have wasted all this time.
goodnight386,We talked about being at the right place at the right time and we ended up to the conclusion that we  haven’t been at the right place and the right time and we will be there someday soon if we keep try.
goodnight386,So here I am try to be positive and yes keep trying.

goodnight296,I think it is time for me to move on.
goodnight296,The girl I like does not seems to be on the same page as me and I don’t want to push her to do anything.
goodnight296,She already has a lot to take care of her own.
goodnight296,Sometimes you have to make a decision that you don’t really want but I do understand that it is inevitable sometimes.
goodnight296,At the end, I want her to be happy and so do I.
goodnight296,To do that, I’m going back to what it was before when I saw her for the first time when I only see her As friend and I believe it’s better for everybody around me.
goodnight296,I’m so glad tho that I met all these friends who I can depend on including her.

goodnight404,It actually wasn’t a big deal.
goodnight404,I have been having that for years now.
goodnight404,However, every time when I get rejected for better opportunity that I want, I get frustrated little bit.
goodnight404,I just need to do something to get over it so I eat.
goodnight404,The good thing is that I already got over and moving on to other opportunities.

goodnight685,working on responsive layout for the site.
goodnight685,fixed log-in input fields and top navigation that covered top part of the contents.
goodnight685,if you have a screen resolution lower than 744 px width, you will see mobile version layout.
goodnight685,I’m still working on this issue n will have better layout for mobile device, tablets, and computers.
goodnight685,Good thing that I actually work on WP theme at work which makes my job easier to work on this site after work cause I learn something new pretty much everyday about WP and I could just use it right away in this site.
goodnight685,I’m also thinking about getting new design for the site.

goodnight281,It can be very excited or very sad.
goodnight281,It will be all clear in a month or two but I know till then I won’t be able to get rid of all these thoughts.
goodnight281,Life is so unexpected even after all theses plans.
goodnight281,I guess I will just have to find the best way for me to go and try my best at the moment.
goodnight281,For now tho, I just wanna forget about everything and be relaxed. 
goodnight281,
goodnight422,
goodnight422,Woke up around 8am and craving porkchop for some reason with grape lol.
goodnight422,So I went ro grocery market got porkchop and grape.
goodnight422,I was confidence that I could cook porkchop really good as my friend cooked for me couple days ago cause I still have all the spices she picked up.
goodnight422,So I tried do the same as she did and it turned out ok visually but the taste was not the same.
goodnight422,I must missed something or put something else it doesn’t need.
goodnight422,I should have payed for attention when she cooked it.
goodnight422,Well it doesn’t tastes bad though.
goodnight422,We are having a beautiful sunny day here in chicago.

goodnight690,It was busy day for me did bunch of things  until now.
goodnight690,Well, now that I don’t really have anything to do makes me think about stupid things like what’s the most important thing in my life, what am I pursuing for ... Etc etc.. Can’t even describe what I’m thinking its just so messy n complicated.
goodnight690,Maybe I should just keep myself really busy for a while or take another vacation to somewhere to clear my head.
goodnight690,
goodnight695,
goodnight695,I been doing some research about keeping a journal n it got me thinking that why do I wanna write a journal.
goodnight695,For me, writing a journal makes me feel peaceful.

goodnight695,About 10 mins of time I get to write a journal makes me to clear my head n organize things.

goodnight337,I realized that I have things to do but don’t really know where to start.
goodnight337,I obviously need some time to sit down and writing down things I need to get done be priority to get the place I want to be.
goodnight337,I have been little just a little frustrated by not getting things that I have been trying for years which is fine cause I got used to it.
goodnight337,However, it sometimes becomes hard on me to accept that fact.
goodnight337,The bottom line is I never give up trying until I get that.
goodnight337,it’s 10:15pm here in Chicago.
goodnight337,The weather is still freezing and I’m still hoping/trying to get that thing I want  to do that I need a list of things that I need to do now to get that!

goodnight400,Still working out on my lunch break and I got down to 155 lb.
goodnight400,5 more pounds to go then I just have to keep it that way.

goodnight400,just thought it was weird.
goodnight400,I still have 2 freelance works going on but nothing has to be done today cause I’m waiting for the response for both of them.
goodnight400,Also started working on child theme on Ohsik(the WordPress theme I developed) so it will be more attractive for people to download the theme.

goodnight400,Well I did not even get the boxes which I have to do it be end of this week.

goodnight400,It’s 8:15 PM and I’m too lazy to go out and my ear infection stops me to go gym for swimming.
goodnight400,I guess I will just go to sleep early.
goodnight400,I always want to make mobile application for GoodNightJournal but still haven’t find the way to do it but for now I’m thinking starting with UI design and keep looking for the way to build it.

goodnight541,How’s your night going?
goodnight541,
goodnight357,
goodnight357,like this weeks prayer of confession.
goodnight357,Sounds like something I would pray these days.
goodnight357,I’m sharing this here.
goodnight357,In our times of joy and our times of sorrow God is always present with us.
goodnight357,Let us turn now, together, to ask God to be with us even when we are at our most vulnerable.
goodnight357,Let us pray:
goodnight357,Ever present God, sometimes life doesn’t look like we want it to look.
goodnight357,We think if only we try harder, or pray more, or smile all day, or say just the right thing or look just the right way life will all come together and make sense.
goodnight357,But, it doesn’t.
goodnight357,Or it does.
goodnight357,Either way, it’s lonely.
goodnight357,Remind us that you are in this with us.
goodnight357,Broaden our ideas about healing so we can find you in the midst of our struggle.
goodnight357,Forgive our self-reliance.
goodnight357,Help us to see you.
goodnight357,Amen.

goodnight523,
goodnight523,I know I have to do something but I don’t know what that is.
goodnight523,keep trying to move forward without having a certain destination does not give me anything.
goodnight523,I think I really need some time to seat down and re-build my life plans.
goodnight523,Last time when I actually wrote down my life plans was like 5 years ago and since then lot of things changed.
goodnight523,so where to start?
goodnight523,lol
goodnight523,
goodnight420,
goodnight420,Maybe I have been trying to hide my real feelings.
goodnight420,Pretend to be happy all the time try to hide my weaknesses.
goodnight420,In fact that today I felt very depressed by no reason.
goodnight420,Just had same typical day but by the time when I got home I become all emotional all the sudden.
goodnight420,My cousin told me its coming from the weight loose thing that I’m doing (no food after 6pm) but I don’t thing that’s the reason but still have no idea why.
goodnight420,This happens quite amount of times lately.
goodnight420,I feel like I need to do something but don’t know what.
goodnight420,I just wanna fell asleep for now.
goodnight420,
goodnight462,
goodnight462,Well it’s been about 3 weeks or almost a month that I have been working on this project.
goodnight462,I still putting all my free time on this.
goodnight462,I was really frustrated for past week about the one technical thing that I failed to get a solution but tonight I made some improvement that possibly solve that problem eventually.
goodnight462,Looking back this week, I did not do much just working and my personal project.
goodnight462,Thinking about going bible study and volunteer work but I don’t know if I’m gonna make it.
goodnight462,For now I just want to get this project done.
goodnight462,I know there are gonna be more problems to solve but I will just take it step by step till I get what I want.
goodnight462,Goodnight everyone.
goodnight462,
goodnight274,
goodnight274,So since Anton got me back into iOS developer program, I decided to update iOS app for GoodnightJournal.com and I just uploaded new app to iTunes connect which will be reviewed by Apple people and will go on App Store eventually.
goodnight274,I’m using the new app to write this journal now and hoping it will work as I interned  Yes, I got lazy to test it properly before I submit it lol 
goodnight274,I just got a notification of completion for the process.
goodnight274,I have to go update all the art assets.
goodnight274,I feel very productive for doing this on Saturday night after a long day of skating 
goodnight274,Hope this will get more people to write journal here.
goodnight274,

goodnight368,Couldn’t really have time to look through all my projects and this site.
goodnight368,I know that I have to get back to it but just can’t get the time for this.
goodnight368,Maybe I’m not motivated enough now.
goodnight368,Well, I found this guy’s portfolio site today which actually got me motivated little bit.
goodnight368,His portfolio is so beautiful makes mind looks like a junk.
goodnight368,Now I see why I haven’t got a luck on all my attemptings.
goodnight368,Yes it’s time to get back to work!
goodnight368,Get motivated!!!
goodnight368,It has been raining all day.
goodnight368,Work was okay felt little slow all day.
goodnight368,Started work out for the triathlon training.
goodnight368,I biked for 7 miles and run/walk for 3 miles.

goodnight368,I have to work out regularly now on.
goodnight368,Not much going on.
goodnight368,Just typical stuffs with endless hope of something better...

goodnight351,Things seems fine and now it’s time to move forward again.
goodnight351,The Miami trip with friends was amazing!!
goodnight351,I had so much fun.
goodnight351,Just had little hard time today to get back to real life  It’s so cold in Chicago!!
goodnight351,I think I’m gonna sleep now..

goodnight303,J is still packing up his stuffs to move out and I’m just helping + being lazy.
goodnight303,Well mostly being lazy... Just making sure I stay home in case he needs help.
goodnight303,I’m going to work on new design on GoodnightJournal.com but don’t feel like starting it now.
goodnight303,Maybe tmw... or not...
goodnight303,Peaceful Sunday!
goodnight303,probably will go see the walking dead with friends at night.
goodnight303,That’s pretty much it!
goodnight303,Damn I think this depressing weather makes me wanna smoke lol
goodnight303,
goodnight566,
goodnight566,Feel like I’m missing something or empty.
goodnight566,Weird feeling I don’t really like it just making me nervous little.
goodnight566,Working, gym on lunch break (swam for today caused by hot weather), practicing speaking, laundry, BBQ chicken.
goodnight566,Yeah that’s pretty much it ohh and still tired little bit lol.
goodnight566,Read script almost 100 times now.
goodnight566,Still not good enough but definetly getting better.
goodnight566,Hope this thing works out well.
goodnight566,I’m not afraid to success or fail  
goodnight566,Sharing the story board for the video.
goodnight566,
goodnight638,
goodnight638,I thought I forgot about it.
goodnight638,I believed that I moved on.
goodnight638,However, it started to appear again.
goodnight638,not sure it’s just happening right now or will stay tmw and more.
goodnight638,However, right now I’m thinking about the things I wanted to get before like about an year ago  maybe I never forget about this until I actually get this and I don’t think I completely gave up on it.
goodnight638,I am taking detour right now but I will get there eventually.
goodnight638,right now I just must be aware of that all the time and keep try things instead of being lazy lol.
goodnight638,
goodnight613,
goodnight613,got new design today that I have been working on for about a month.
goodnight613,still needs improvements but works ok for now.

goodnight310,Tuesday but it feels like Thursday.
goodnight310,I haven’t really done anything this week Monday and today.
goodnight310,Just work and home.
goodnight310,I did nothing yesterday after work.
goodnight310,Just rolling around on my bed for little bit, later dinner and TV then had a trouble going sleep... Fortunately, I didn’t really feel tired at all today at work cause I was fully focused on the project all day.
goodnight310,I decided to build a plug-in for myself for this site since the one I paid is not really working out.
goodnight310,I don’t know if I’m gonna be able to get it done or not but I will try.
goodnight310,It makes more sense more me to have control for the main functionally of the site.
goodnight310,I can also make it more flexible that way since I want to make this more user friendly.
goodnight310,11:22 PM now in Chicago.
goodnight310,The weather is getting chilly everyday.
goodnight310,Winter is really coming.
goodnight310,Hopefully, this winter will be different.
goodnight310,Just expecting something new I guess 
goodnight310,
goodnight623,
goodnight623,got my third cold in this year.
goodnight623,I don’t know why I keep getting cold.
goodnight623,It usually comes once or twice in years but some reason I got third one already this year lol.
goodnight623,I’m feeling better today tho hopefully I get this over by tmw so I don’t have to suffer at work.
goodnight623,the weather is so nice today but I’m just staying home n being lazy all day.
goodnight623,
goodnight353,
goodnight353,And this time, the screen went off... I believe the phone is working but I can’t see or use anything on the phone cause the screen went dark  It’s been about 3 to 4 months when I fixed my screen.
goodnight353,I don’t think I’m going to spend couple hundred dollars again to fix my phone.
goodnight353,It’s seems to be better off with new phone since I wanted to move back to iPhone.
goodnight353,I just need some time to think about it before I make purchase.
goodnight353,I have been spending lots of money lately and have some things coming that I need to spend money even more.
goodnight353,So I just need to plan this out.
goodnight353,Well it sucks 
goodnight353,
goodnight433,
goodnight433,Had a lot of thoughts at work and don’t really know that was necessary or not.
goodnight433,Nothing special just things that I always think about.
goodnight433,The traffic on the way back home was awesome only took 35 mins to get home.
goodnight433,Hope it’s like this everyday.
goodnight433,Didn’t do much at home just took a shower n watching a movie.
goodnight433,Trying to go to sleep early since I had trouble sleeping last night.
goodnight433,I have been too lazy lately.
goodnight433,It’s time to get back to track but still not sure where to go.
goodnight433,Well I will fine it soon!
goodnight433,Goodnight!
goodnight433,
goodnight662,
goodnight662,Church in the morning.
goodnight662,Went to the closest Presbyterian church from my place cause all my family go to Presbyterian church.
goodnight662,Took about 20 mins to walk there.
goodnight662,It was little bit cold but the weather was nice enough to walk.
goodnight662,The church was actually really good.
goodnight662,Decent size, kind paster, n no one bother me to be a member.
goodnight662,I guess I will go there every Sunday now on.
goodnight662,Met up with a friend later n shopping.
goodnight662,I bought an awesome plant at Ikea n a futon at walmart.
goodnight662,Very satisfied for both of them.
goodnight662,Dinner at china town for johns bday n short meeting about jioh7.
goodnight662,It’s coming soon 
goodnight662,
goodnight493,
goodnight493,Didn’t have good day at work.
goodnight493,Well nothing happended, I just felt like I didn’t get enough opportunities to be creative n do something that really metters to the company.
goodnight493,I am ready n can do whatever it needs to get done but I don’t even get a chance to show what I can do.
goodnight493,Every time I try it just disappeared in the middle of the chain.
goodnight493,I really want to do things that matters n I will.
goodnight493,Yes I often think like this when I have no projects going on.
goodnight493,I guess I just have to be busy all the time.
goodnight493,
goodnight449,
goodnight449,I spent the laziest Sunday in like 2 months.
goodnight449,I have been lazy from last night when I decided not to go to the party at my friend place.
goodnight449,Since then, I just stayed at my apartment and did not really do anything but sleeping and eating lol.
goodnight449,Despite I went to bed earlier than usual last night, I woke up really late today and even skipped the church.
goodnight449,Some reason I just did not wanna do anything but being lazy.
goodnight449,So I did that all day long.
goodnight449,Woke up late, took a nap and spent most of the day on my bed and couch.
goodnight449,Now it’s 11:21 and trying to be little bit productive by writing a journal for a day.
goodnight449,Although I have been lazy all day with no motivation, I felt like 90% recharged and I wanna feel like 100% recharged when I wake up tomorrow morning.
goodnight449,Hope you had great weekend!
goodnight449,goodnight!
goodnight449,
goodnight616,
goodnight616,I don’t really have nothing special to write today.
goodnight616,did exact same things that I do pretty much everyday.
goodnight616,the weather was amazing tho.
goodnight616,the building that I work at wasn’t ready for the AC today so I was sweating little bit at work it was kind of annoying.
goodnight616,did work out on a lunch break and ran after work for an hour.
goodnight616,now I am at my place sitting at the computer trying to think something to write on my journal 
goodnight616,
goodnight397,
goodnight397,Such a beatutiful day on mother’s day!
goodnight397,I’m very happy about the weather today.
goodnight397,It just makes me feel so good and I believe it does same to others as well.
goodnight397,I could tell by people I taked today while I walked back to home from church.
goodnight397,Took some picture at my apartment cause it looks beautiful.
goodnight397,I think I got some thing to organizr before I get out for meeting at Belmont harbor.
goodnight397,Hope you all have a great mother’s day!
goodnight397,
goodnight474,
goodnight474,So these are the things I ate tonight for dinner.
goodnight474,I ate so much my belly is about to explode.
goodnight474,Although I know that I’m full, my brain keeps telling me to eat more and I’m having hard time to fight against it.
goodnight474,It’s happening lately that I constantly want more food.
goodnight474,that explains that why I was in the buffet restaurant last night lol
goodnight474,
goodnight291,
goodnight291,My journal for Wednesday!
goodnight291,I had a very typical day today.
goodnight291,Work and work out then drive right back to home.
goodnight291,I did pretty much everything that I was thinking about to do when I get home.
goodnight291,However, I couldn’t finish couple things.
goodnight291,Updating my portfolio which I started but couldn’t really get into it cause I noticed it will take longer than I thought.
goodnight291,It seems to be needing at least couple of days to get done.
goodnight291,So I’m taking it slowly lol.
goodnight291,Also need to check out some new technologies that I haven’t got a chance to use it yet.
goodnight291,That will be interesting.
goodnight291,It’s 11:37 PM and I already feel so sleepy.
goodnight291,Already on my bed and ready to sleep!
goodnight291,Thursday tmw then Friday!
goodnight291,Can’t wait for the weekend!
goodnight291,Goodnight all!

goodnight291,
goodnight369,
goodnight369,First time when I moved here to Chicago from Korea in 2006, I met some friends who also came here to learn English.
goodnight369,We became good friends and spent about 2 years in Chicago hanging out pretty much every weekends together.
goodnight369,It’s been over 8 years now and most of them already left here went back to Korea for the good reason or they just had to.
goodnight369,Today, I had to say goodbye to the very last one who’s been here with me till today.
goodnight369,I took a day off today to spend time with him and dropped him off at airport.
goodnight369,Feels little weird that makes me feel like I’m the only one left here.
goodnight369,Well I just wish them the best luck in Korea and one day we maybe get together again and talk about everything.
goodnight369,I’m glad tho that everyone is moving forward for their life and career.
goodnight369,And many other good friends here in Chicago around me who probably won’t move to any other country 
goodnight369,So I’m starting week by tomorrow and hope it won’t get cold as today lol
goodnight369,Goodnight!
goodnight369,
goodnight649,
goodnight649,typical.things I wanted to do, plans for the future, promises I made for myself all starting to scatter away.
goodnight649,I don’t expect things to happen over night.
goodnight649,However, I want to see little bit of improvement on it and I don’t think I see it or I just don’t notice it for now.
goodnight649,Regardless of all that, I just gotta do what I have to do.
goodnight649,Yeah, I just have so many thoughts on my head lol
goodnight649,
goodnight514,
goodnight514,got up at 2:30 AM could not go back to sleep since then.
goodnight514,just been watching couple video clips from youtube and going through GoodNightJournal.
goodnight514,I will probably have tough time at work today by not having enough sleep but I can’t go back to sleep just craving for steak.
goodnight514,I’m gonna go to grocery store at 6 and buy 5 steaks for breakfast.
goodnight514,
goodnight289,
goodnight289,Snowing day in Chicago!
goodnight289,Feel like I was pretty busy this weekend.
goodnight289,However, there were not many productive things except for having great time with friends lol.
goodnight289,Today I started a day with church and brunch after.
goodnight289,Then meet up with Anton and Natialia at Dollops to work on our first iOS app Complimenter.
goodnight289,It was just amazing how fast Anton built the app and we ended up with a working app after 2 hours maybe less.
goodnight289,Well it obviously needs more improvement but good enough to see how it works and get feedback from others.
goodnight289,I’m actually getting very excited for this.
goodnight289,Stayed there till 5:45 PM then headed to Miao for the walking dead show and chineses new year dumpling party.
goodnight289,Ate so much dumpling and beer also watched the walking dead.
goodnight289,Back home now and about to go to sleep.
goodnight289,11:30 PM now I know I’m ready for sleep but not sure if I’m ready for Monday yet lol.
goodnight289,Goodnight everyone!
goodnight289,
goodnight306,
goodnight306,Things are pretty much the same.
goodnight306,Same work, apartment and skating.
goodnight306,Getting little tired of same repeated daily life but have not really get any good news to break that circle and it costs too much to take a risk at the moment.
goodnight306,However, I know that I want some changes in my life.
goodnight306,Been spending my free time on new update on GoodnightJournal.com and New WordPress theme I designed for WP repository.
goodnight306,It bothers me little that plugin I purchased has some issues that effect features critically and it really delays everything I have planned.
goodnight306,I really want to have this update to offer better user experience on writing and managing journals but can’t just do that without fixing those issues on the plugin.
goodnight306,I’m still waiting for them to fix.
goodnight306,Also spending lots of time on skating and feel like I got way better on skate skills in past couple day.
goodnight306,Last Sunday session at Belmont harbor with Anton and Jose helped a lot for me to get to next level.
goodnight306,I love the jump and Mabrouk videos from last Sunday.
goodnight306,Can’t stop watching it 
goodnight306,Well that’s about it.
goodnight306,I just have to get things done!
goodnight306,Goodnight everyone!
goodnight306,
goodnight513,
goodnight513,So I have been working crazy on new design on this site.
goodnight513,Just wanna give u a hand up that it does not have significant changes but better design for u to use (I really wish).
goodnight513,I spent 99% of free time on this on last three days and it will be up in a day  Then I will improve more and more gradually.
goodnight513,Anyways, hope u all having great Saturday night.
goodnight513,
goodnight483,
goodnight483,I felt like starting a new week today in the morning when I get work then I realized it’s Thursday.
goodnight483,Damn one more day and it’s weekend again.
goodnight483,I love it!
goodnight483,I have a day off on next monday n morning on Thursday which means I only have to work 2 and a half days.
goodnight483,I just have to find way to spend all these time productively cause I have been wasting a lot of time for watching stupid soap operas lol.
goodnight483,That just made me think about the past.
goodnight483,
goodnight375,
goodnight375,Maybe I have been pursuing for something way too big.
goodnight375,Skipping all the steps in the middle and just want to jump right on it.
goodnight375,I have seen this article today that makes me think in a different way.
goodnight375,Maybe I should start with small things and try to get things one by one instead of taking a short cut that might not even exist.
goodnight375,Now I kind of see where all these frustration and disappointment come from.
goodnight375,So here I am trying to see what’s my next small step’s gonna be...
goodnight375,
goodnight367,
goodnight367,@anniecat Thank you so much for the notice on this issue.
goodnight367,There was an issue with commenting on the site and it has been fixed now.

goodnight367,
goodnight634,
goodnight634,She called me today and we talked about 30mins to talk about everything as usual.
goodnight634,I found myself that I actually enjoy a lot to talk with my mom as I get older.
goodnight634,Asked her about North Korea since the media talks about North Korea a lot lately, it bothers me all the time cause my whole family is in South Korea.
goodnight634,However, she said everything is fine over there and people in South Korea don’t really worry about it at all which made me feel relived.
goodnight634,I kind of want my whole family to move here and live with me though, cause I miss them and North Korea still seems very unstable to me.
goodnight634,Lately, the marriage became hot issue for my mom.
goodnight634,every time I talked her over the phone, she never forgot to ask me about girl friend and when I said no, she starts to mentioning about arrangement marriage for the girls that she knows in Korea.
goodnight634,lol I feel little bit of pressure but I really don’t want to rush things up for this issue.
goodnight634,I still believe that I will meet someone someday who makes me want to get married.
goodnight634,well no more thinking about marriage that’s too much for me right now.
goodnight634,I will just go to sleep for tmw since I have to be at work by 9am, I have to wake up an hour early.
goodnight634,
goodnight438,
goodnight438,Sunday night diary, probably the best time to write a diary cause I usually spend some time on Sunday night to look back past week and planing the next week.
goodnight438,So looking back last week, I was just struggling on my new project all week.
goodnight438,nothing was really going on beside that cause I spend all my free time on that.
goodnight438,For next week, I want to launch the site.
goodnight438,I gave up the function I want and decided to change the direction little bit.
goodnight438,However if it goes well, I will get definitely that function in the site.
goodnight438,Well that’s that, I did a lot today.
goodnight438,church in the morning, laundry, cleaning up my apartment, went to shopping with my cousin and had dinner with more cousins.
goodnight438,I treated them today cause I got raised last week.
goodnight438,that my boss promised last year.
goodnight438,back home around 9PM, sitting at my computer trying to setup parkMartini again.
goodnight438,That’s all I did today.
goodnight438,How was yours?
goodnight438,how do u usually spend Sunday night?
goodnight438,?
goodnight438,
goodnight705,
goodnight705,Kind of expected little bit last night that I felt like I’m gonna get a cold and when I woke up today, I definitely felt that I’m getting sick.
goodnight705,cough and horrible runny nose.
goodnight705,especially the runny nose drives me crazy.
goodnight705,had over 1 liter of tea and hoping to get better soon.
goodnight705,I really wish to get better when I wake up tomorrow.
goodnight705,I don’t wanna get sick cause I don’t really have anyone to take care of me at this moment.
goodnight705,
goodnight308,
goodnight308,I have been thinking about new design on GoodnightJournal for about a month now.
goodnight308,Maybe over a month.
goodnight308,It took me almost 2 months to develop a plugin that I can use on main feature on GoodnightJournal and it is finally good enough to actually use it on site.
goodnight308,Yes, it is not perfect but just good enough to take a first step.
goodnight308,I will of course spend more time to make it better and this improvement will never end!
goodnight308,Decided to go with one of my theme Simtiful for the main layout and will add more modifications on features on the site.
goodnight308,The biggest mistake I have which I’m very well aware of is I did not really make actual design of the new site.
goodnight308,I have been thinking about this for long enough time I think I can just work on things our of my head.
goodnight308,There will me lots of tweaking but this will work out well.
goodnight308,Although I have the new design in my head, I still need to list out things I need to do to get the new design and some more details I need to add.
goodnight308,I would say I got about 10% done now maybe less but just can’t wait to show it to everybody.
goodnight308,Hope I can just focus on this projects all day for about 2 weeks!
goodnight308,
goodnight591,
goodnight591,Check out Angela’s article about writing a diary!
goodnight591,Self expression.
goodnight591,One of my favourite reasons for writing a diary is the ability to express what I’m feeling and thinking and by writing it down I’m channelling that energy into something just for me!
goodnight591,Actually my diary is filled with bus tickets, sketches, poems or articles I’ve read, quotes and interesting pieces of conversations.
goodnight591,I mix these with colours, and designs, and of course the way I write.
goodnight591,For example, I may write in Spanish or English, and my handwriting always changes.
goodnight591,I turn the pages and write in different directions or in capitals.
goodnight591,I like to explore different ways and write in the way it feels good for me at that time.
goodnight591,Nowadays I only buy diaries with blank pages so I have the freedom to create whatever I want on that page.
goodnight591,Express yourself through your diary.
goodnight591,Time for you.
goodnight591,Giving yourself time to write in your diary is literally setting aside time just for you, be it every week, every day or whatever.
goodnight591,Quality alone time.
goodnight591,I love to be on my own, writing down my thoughts and be able to come away from whatever environment I find myself in.
goodnight591,If your travelling or you live with other people, your dairy writing time can be a real treasured time of the day.
goodnight591,Wicked.
goodnight591,Writing is Therapeutic.
goodnight591,Writing out your ideas / inspirations / troubles and all your daily stuff is therapy.
goodnight591,An awesome one.
goodnight591,It gives you a freedom to express yourself and allows the words to flow out.
goodnight591,You can think things over and reflect.
goodnight591,It for sure contributes to a sense of well-being, sometimes I begin writing in a terrible mood and by the time I’ve finished I’m feeling on top of the world.
goodnight591,Write down your versions of events!
goodnight591,Re-reading and memories...
goodnight591,I cannot tell you how much I love, love, love re-reading my diary.
goodnight591,When I turn up in a new place or start a new part of my life, I like to write what I want to achieve or my first impressions and re-reading these is so much fun.
goodnight591,It’s also a really cool reference to look back at what you were doing at that time and you can see how much you’ve evolved!
goodnight591,Memories you forgot you had appear in personal detailed form... Also you can look back in pure embarrassment of the things you’ve done, which makes for great entertainment.
goodnight591,One reason why my diary is a private one.
goodnight591,Goal Setting.
goodnight591,Writing down dreams and ambitions is a beginning to step to achieving them.
goodnight591,Sometimes we have goals and forget all about them, only to return later and find we’ve completed them.
goodnight591,A while back I found myself reading a dairy of 2009.
goodnight591,I’d written one of the things I’d love to try in the world was tango dancing.
goodnight591,Completely unaware it was a thought that had occurred to me beforehand, I turned up in Argentina three years later and dedicated some time for learning to dance tango.
goodnight591,This has happened to me a lot, from riding horses to travelling certain countries... It’s also great to re-read for a reference, to write this blog I need to go back through all my dairies to trigger the memories I forgot I had..
goodnight591,A present just for you.
goodnight591,Your dairy is just for you.
goodnight591,It’s not something you have to share and it’s simply having an activity and dedication that is 100% yours..
goodnight591,Whether your writing about something you’ve seen on TV that’s inspired you, or day-to-day stuff.
goodnight591,It’s yours 100% your own creation of your life.
goodnight591,Get to know yourself better.
goodnight591,You get to spend time writing about what you have done, how you’ve reacted, what inspires you, what are you passionate about, the more you write, the more you see patterns and have more quality ‘you time’.
goodnight591,Get to know yourself more...
goodnight591,Creativity.
goodnight591,As mentioned above you can express yourself 100% and you can get really creative with your content.
goodnight591,I sometimes write in the 3rd person form, or I’ve even tried writing in Shakespearean language.
goodnight591,You can create poems if you feel inspired, simply, there are no rules!
goodnight591,Improving on those writing skills.
goodnight591,Just with any skill, the more you do it, the better you get.
goodnight591,So writing either daily or weekly helps you maintain and improve your writing skills!
goodnight591,And that’s just a bonus!
goodnight591,A little something for your grandchildren to read.
goodnight591,I would have loved to have read my grandparents dairy.
goodnight591,What life was like for them, in this ever-changing world and just the normal stuff they did day to day.
goodnight591,I’m sure grand-kids would love to read about ‘life before the mobile phone.’ It already seems like a lifetime ago...

goodnight708,

goodnight708,Well, I thought my life was goin well just like what I planned n it did till before I came here.
goodnight708,I was confident, I thought I could get whatever I want.
goodnight708,However, it didn’t take that long too realize that life isn’t always go as u planned or expected.
goodnight708,Lack of preparation might caused all these situations to me but beside that I didn’t have any contingency plans n now I’m just collapsing.
goodnight708,Well, now I learn that things don’t always go as u planned or expected n it’s always good to have contingency plans.
goodnight708,However, i don’t regret for what I did.
goodnight708,At least i got to try what I wanted to do.
goodnight708,Now, it’s just time for me to move on.
goodnight708,
goodnight657,
goodnight657,Still cold little bit but its definitely getting Warmer.

goodnight579,
goodnight313,
goodnight313,felt little weird for getting rejected cause I’m not used to it cause I don’t usually try that much.
goodnight313,I was kind of hoping maybe she is the one for me but it does not seem like it anymore.
goodnight313,It is funny that I write a journal with this issue that I usually don’t.
goodnight313,I guess at the end I’m just a normal person.
goodnight313,I want to see why she said she can’t but I don’t know it’s worth it.
goodnight313,Just writing things down to make my feel better.
goodnight313,It’s been a very long week and lots to think about.
goodnight313,10:49pm on my bed, trying to go to sleep...

goodnight304,I have been working on a new project for GoodnightJournal.com!
goodnight304,As it grows everyday, I noticed that it is crucial to have entire control of the site for main features.
goodnight304,Although my programming skill is not there yet, I decided to make a plugin that will allow people to write articles from front-end on WordPress.
goodnight304,I actually made lot of progress last week and hoping to get something this week.
goodnight304,All I have to do at this point is to add editing feature and test it to see it work properly.
goodnight304,I’m very excited about this!
goodnight304,so I can offer better features with much better user experience that I have been wanting to improve for very long time!
goodnight304,It’s sunny Sunday afternoon!

goodnight340,I just submitted GoodnightJournal iOS app to Apple’s App Store and had to pay $100 per year to do that(too expensive I think compare to Google Play Store).
goodnight340,I’m not sure how long it will take that to be approved and be available in App Store.
goodnight340,However, I feel very accomplished now.
goodnight340,Spent all night working on the app and spent pretty much all week to figure out how to make it work.
goodnight340,Well had to go through bunch of tutorial videos to make it happen.
goodnight340,I wanna give you a hand up that the first version is not gonna be perfect but I will try to improve it continuously.
goodnight340,So more people can enjoy writing journals.

goodnight673,
goodnight656,
goodnight656,I just finished everything I planned to do today and its not midnight yet which means I can go to sleep early.
goodnight656,Today, I got stressed out little bit about the process I’m going through.
goodnight656,It’s so complicated and involves so many docs and people.
goodnight656,I’m getting kind of irritated for following up all that.
goodnight656,However, they are no shortcuts, I just have to do it.
goodnight656,My refrigerator has been broken 2 days so today when I got home, I ate pretty much everything I had in my fridge.
goodnight656,Now I’m having really hard time to digest all that lol I will probably walk around my small living room for a while before I go to sleep.
goodnight656,Good night everyone n don’t forget to write a journal 
goodnight656,
goodnight460,
goodnight460,I don’t really have anything to write today except for that I got little depressed by something that I was expecting to see but did not happen.
goodnight460,I have been trying get something for months but I’m not getting anything back from it.
goodnight460,I kind of got used to it but sometimes I just get frustrated.
goodnight460,I guess today is the one of those days.
goodnight460,Even though I don’t get anything back or it gets me frustrated, I won’t give up cause I can’t live without goals or hope 
goodnight460,hopefully, things happen in year of 2014.
goodnight460,Goodnight!
goodnight460,
goodnight297,

goodnight515,As we get more traffics and members on the site, the amount of spam posts has increase significantly.
goodnight515,On Oct/30/2013 I decided to set up anti-spam system on the site that suppose to block spammer to post inappropriate content that irritates other users on the site.
goodnight515,However, the system turned out to be blocking some real members to login to the site.
goodnight515,I apologize to all the members who had experience trouble logging in to the site.
goodnight515,As today, I removed anti-spam system completely on the site and you won’t have trouble to login to the site.

goodnight330,I had a very typical Sunday.
goodnight330,Church, laundry, journals and watching the game of throne with friends.
goodnight330,Also had huge lunch with John at sushi para.
goodnight330,It is 12:16 AM now and I am ready to sleep.

goodnight330,Goodnight everyone 
goodnight330,
goodnight539,
goodnight539,I had a very long day today that I didn’t expected.
goodnight539,We had some sort of emergency at work that has to be taking care of in today.
goodnight539,So we stayed n worked till mid night from 10 am well some people worked from 9.
goodnight539,So tired now fully ready to fell asleep.
goodnight539,Good night.
goodnight539,
goodnight699,
goodnight699,Lately, I have a problem with sleeping.
goodnight699,couldn’t go to sleep till like 7 in the morning or something for whole week.
goodnight699,For a week, I fell a sleep around that time and wake up around 1pm but today I had to wake up by 10am to go to church.
goodnight699,I finally fell a sleep about 8 in the morning woke up around 10:50am by text message from olga lol.
goodnight699,couldn’t even take a shower just got my clothes on and went to church and stayed there till 4pm.
goodnight699,for the entire time, I was like half unconscious but I wanted to stay since it’s my last time to go that church and meet those people.
goodnight699,got back home around 4:30 took a shower and i’m ready to go to sleep now  it’s 5:40pm here.
goodnight699,N some reason I been up till now at 12:46am n can’t go to sleep again lol omg this is a torture
goodnight699,
goodnight542,
goodnight542,So my tripod finally arrived and noticed it shipped from Indiana which would take no more than couple hours  to drive there from Chicago.
goodnight542,Some how it took almost a week but the good thing is that I finally have it and I can start my thing going.
goodnight542,I set up all the light sources I have for the video as it shown on the picture.
goodnight542,As I expected, it was not enough lights to get the quality I want.
goodnight542,Now I’m debating myself on either spending couple hundred dollars for photography kit or just find way to work around it.
goodnight542,The biggest problem I have now is the shadow come from poor lighting set up.
goodnight542,I have noticed before when I worked on 3D stuffs that lighting set up is very important and difficult and now I get the same feeling again.
goodnight542,I will do some more research to see if I can save couple hundred dollars for things that I probably going to use once.
goodnight542,Anyways, I feel relieved for finally getting started again on my project.
goodnight542,
goodnight408,
goodnight408,Don’t really have much to write.
goodnight408,This is because I do pretty much same thing everyday.
goodnight408,Work all day, some work out, and more computer stuffs at home.
goodnight408,I just try to write down things I did today to keep in track and try to come up with better plan for tomorrow.
goodnight408,The weather was beautiful today, over 80 degrees on day time but it’s got rained at night.
goodnight408,Today, I went to pick up the bike from my friend place.
goodnight408,I drove to my friend place and we biked to my place for about 40 mins then we took a bus back to get my car back after having huge dinner at pizza place.
goodnight408,Today, I realized that I haven’t ridden a bike for over 8 years and forgotten about how fun it is.
goodnight408,Now that I got a bike, I will probably go on bike at least once a week.
goodnight408,I’m very excited about it.
goodnight408,This week, I don’t have a lot going on.
goodnight408,Just have on on going project that I have been waiting for the response for weeks.
goodnight408,It seems like a good time to organize my personal projects to see how am I going to spend my free time productively.
goodnight408,I and my friend talked about life and future little bit on the bus ride.
goodnight408,It didn’t really get into any answers as usual.
goodnight408,We just know we want to be successful but not really sure how even with a plan cause we know plans do not always work out as it intended.
goodnight408,Well it just got me think about things I have done and I want to achieve.
goodnight408,The bottom line is that I still have lots to accomplish and I won’t give up till I get all that!
goodnight408,Goodnight everyone.
goodnight408,
goodnight410,
goodnight410,Nothing special.
goodnight410,Just another Money that I work and did not really go anything after that.
goodnight410,Work out on lunch break as usual but couldn’t go out for skating or running cause of the weather.
goodnight410,The thing is that it didn’t actually rain in Chicago but it seemed like it will be rain soon for like all day.
goodnight410,Weather forecast said the same thing which made me stay at home.
goodnight410,I don’t like this sneaky weather.
goodnight410,Instead of going out, I spent time working on the UI project that pretty much takes up all my free time for weeks.
goodnight410,I need to finish this project soon and move on to other ones.
goodnight410,Just little bit of polishing up has left.
goodnight410,Had a late dinner myself and trying to see what to do for rest of the night.
goodnight410,It’s 10:50 PM watching Jimmy kimmel while I’m writing this.

goodnight396,I got up at 4:30 AM now I’m fully awake lol I went bed kind of early last night probably around 11:00 PM cause I have a doctor’s appointment in the morning at 9 AM.
goodnight396,However, I did not expect to be up this early.
goodnight396,Since that happened, I decided to enjoy the time.
goodnight396,So I watched the game of throne on the bed and now I’m writing an early journal.
goodnight396,It just passed 6 AM here so the grocery store right cross over the street should be open by now.
goodnight396,I just have to decide what I want to eat for breakfast.
goodnight396,Today, I have to get ready by 8:20 AM, stop by at doctor’s office for my ear, then work, and skating after work.
goodnight396,I don’t know how the weather will be tonight.
goodnight396,I think it will still go unless it rains but one thing we know it will be cold tonight.
goodnight396,I will drive to downtown after work and see how long it takes to get there hopefully not too long.

goodnight527,it does not look that bad right now but they are still talking about it in the news.
goodnight527,
goodnight587,
goodnight587,every time they release new update, I get nervous about GoodNightJournal that something might breaks up on my theme.
goodnight587,However, I want to keep it up to date so it performs faster and better security.
goodnight587,apparently, it works good with my theme on this site so far I tested.
goodnight587,anyways, enjoy journaling!
goodnight587,
goodnight439,
goodnight439,This is the bible phrases that my Dad tells me all the time and I like the most.
goodnight439,I don’t remember when but when I was young, I heard someone saying about the goals in life.
goodnight439,Set your goals as high as you can possible think.
goodnight439,Ever since that, I been having big goals that might not even possible to achieve.
goodnight439,However, one thing I know is that having those big goals get me going and I never give up till I get those.
goodnight439,Every time I read this phrase, makes me think of the goals in my life.
goodnight439,And trying to believe that I’m constantly asking, searching and knock everyday.
goodnight439,
goodnight608,
goodnight608,updated write a journal page to make it simple and easy.
goodnight608,please let me know what u think of new style on write a journal page.
goodnight608,this will be my focus till I get something that works for most people on here.
goodnight608,I think I still need better design on this page.
goodnight608,So Chicago cops found my car in West side of Chicago about 20 mins from my place.
goodnight608,when I got there I got little bit shocked cause everything were gone except for the body itself.
goodnight608,no choice just had to junk it.

goodnight554,work, gym on lunch break, and running by the lake after work.
goodnight554,Weather definitely got cool down which gave me better condition to run for an hour.
goodnight554,I noticed today that footer social media section that I fixed last night resulted a weird page load.
goodnight554,Assuming that was causing by facebook like button.
goodnight554,So I fixed back to what it was and removed send button since it does not seem to be necessary to have.

goodnight285,Weather’s got little warmer but still below 32.

goodnight285,We had 4 pitchers and a 14 inch pizza.
goodnight285,Drank little more that I was expecting but it was a great time!
goodnight285,So glad to have them as friends along with other awesome people!
goodnight285,So things I gotta do tonight is, catching up with my paper journals, get rough layout for the skating event (Suggestions from Gerard) and start working on t-shirt design.
goodnight285,Skating event seems to be going pretty good so far but I know there will be a lot more we have to take care as it goes on.
goodnight285,So trying to anticipate as much as we can now!
goodnight285,I guess not much going on other than that.
goodnight285,Also searching for ways to do marketing for this site.
goodnight285,Sent out couple emails to writers on big sites today.

goodnight652,
goodnight412,
goodnight412,Just wanted to say that cause I’m very happy for getting my internet back.

goodnight529,
goodnight437,
goodnight437,So my sister was asking me about what laptop to buy last night.
goodnight437,so I decided to get her a mac book air.
goodnight437,I tried to purchase it on apple’s Korean website but I couldn’t make it cause of payment process on apple’s Korean site was pain in the ass to go through.
goodnight437,Ended up purchasing on us apple’s site and picked  it up in the apple store at Lincoln park Chicago.
goodnight437,Thing went well till that point.
goodnight437,I had a nice lunch at Ali’s Grill (the cover picture) and went to FedEx to ship the mac book.
goodnight437,I filled out all the form and wrap in up with nice box.
goodnight437,I felt really good for giving her a gift that she needs.
goodnight437,Then the guy at FedEx told me the cost of the shipping will be $269.30 lol I really did not expect that to be that expected but I had no choice except for just paying it and go with FedEx cause USPS and UPS apparently don’t even deal with shipping laptop oversea.
goodnight437,It sucks but just had to go with it.
goodnight437,at this point just hoping that she gets in on time.
goodnight437,Tried to look for the new apartment but did not find one better than the one I’m living now.
goodnight437,Still don’t now if I wanna renew the lease or move out to somewhere else.
goodnight437,Suppose to go to the party my friend’s place but couldn’t make it cause I fell asleep and wake up late lol still feel tired.
goodnight437,Just gonna take a rest for rest of the night.
goodnight437,
goodnight425,
goodnight425,Woke up hours ago but still on my bed with my laptop and being really lazy 😀 I know that I have to do laundry and go gym for swimming but I don’t feel like moving at all lol.
goodnight425,So I’m just spending time on my bed for couple hours and it feels really good.
goodnight425,Just surfing internet and texting with my friends.
goodnight425,So today, I have only have a meeting at night with dinner and rest of day is free.
goodnight425,I will probably clean my apartment after the gym and look for apartment to move in.
goodnight425,It’s kind of hard to find one that I like with the price range that I can afford.
goodnight425,Hopefully I will find one soon.
goodnight425,Have a good weekend everyone!
goodnight425,
goodnight545,
goodnight545,had very typical Monday today.

goodnight307,Hopefully next year will be the same or better 
goodnight307,It’s the day after Christmas and it’s been raining all day here in Chicago.
goodnight307,Could not go out skating because of that but went to gym for swimming instead.
goodnight307,It was lots of fun to swim for an hour after not doing it for a while.
goodnight307,Well, swimming is good but I still feel like I need to find some other activities to do for days like this.
goodnight307,
goodnight472,
goodnight472,Dear diary, I had very busy day at work.
goodnight472,I spent most of day working on new design on the site that has about 10,000 pages of content.
goodnight472,I actually have had a new design from 6 month ago but it never got implemented on the site.
goodnight472,Today, I did improve the design and coded that design into actually website.
goodnight472,Since the site has tons of content and has not been updated for years, I needed to be really careful to make sure everything works good with new design and code.
goodnight472,I think I got about 80% done today and hopefully we can push the site within this week or earlier next week.
goodnight472,Well the bottom line is I had fun to working on that site.
goodnight472,Now I got home 3 hours ago, ate my ass off, took a shower and sitting at my computer thinking about my new project.
goodnight472,Trying to think what to do first...
goodnight472,

goodnight398,I feel like I got really lazy lately for writing journals.
goodnight398,I had somethings to take care of like moving and stuffs.
goodnight398,However even after the moving, I didn’t really keep up with journals as before and I want to change that.
goodnight398,I know writing journal everyday here might be almost impossible but I will try hard to write as many as journals possible for myself.
goodnight398,We had a chilly day today.
goodnight398,I kind of feel like the weather is getting colder and colder.
goodnight398,Despite the  chilly temperature and strong wind, I decided to go out skate when I got home from work cause I know  it will make me feel good and it did.
goodnight398,Skated for about 2 hours and back home had dinner myself then shower.
goodnight398,After that, I have been sitting at my computer doing things I haven’t done so far.
goodnight398,Things finally settling down here at new apartment and my life is getting back to normal.
goodnight398,So I gotta keep move forward again!

goodnight637,it’s 1:40 Am now n I can finally go to sleep.
goodnight637,We have been working on this site for a long time  and still haven’t finished it yet.
goodnight637,apparently it requires more works than we expected.
goodnight637,Anyways, we are making a progress and hopefully we get it done soon.
goodnight637,this is how I started my weekend and I feel good about it cause I feel like I did something productive today after work  I am planning to have lots of nap tomorrow!!!!

goodnight637,
goodnight607,
goodnight607,No choice 
goodnight607,I have to get a new car.
goodnight607,fortunately my parents are willing to help me out with down payment but they don’t want me to spend tons of money on my car.
goodnight607,I was not even in to nice cars anyways but I was thinking about getting Prius.
goodnight607,However, since they want me to spend less money on the car, I’m more leaning towards to Prius C. All my friends are trying to convince me not to get Prius with very important reason that no girls gonna date a guy who drives Prius especial on my age.
goodnight607,that actually almost convinced me.
goodnight607,It was really hard fact to ignore.
goodnight607,However, I found myself an answer that those girls are not the one for me.
goodnight607,I like hybrid car cause it saves environment and I believe someday I will meet a girl who has same opinion with me.
goodnight607,picture from official Toyota website.
goodnight607,
goodnight360,
goodnight360,So I made this site almost 2 years ago when I was in California.
goodnight360,Probably the toughest time in my life.
goodnight360,Those of you who know me probably know what I meant by that  By that time, I just needed to do something and decided to make an website for anyone who wants to write personal journal online.
goodnight360,Since I had been writing journals for over 8 years, it made sense to me to make website for that.
goodnight360,I have been running this site for almost 2 years now and met Sprout from the very beginning of the time on this site.
goodnight360,The amazing lady form Oregon who also has a very cute dog Sprout  Today I received a Christmas card from her that I didn’t expect at all and I really needed to share this good feelings that I got from her.
goodnight360,It really means a lot to me.
goodnight360,I feel very loved and special.
goodnight360,I am very glad that I could meet amazing people in this site and build a good relationships with them.
goodnight360,Sprout always has been my biggest supporter on this site and I really appreciate all the support I got from her.
goodnight360,All those comforting comments on my journals and sharing all those stories and pictures with me and others on the site.
goodnight360,Thank you so much for the Christmas card and all your support!
goodnight360,I wish you a wonderful Christmas and a blessed New Year!
goodnight360,Charlotte, Scott and Sprout

goodnight371,Got off at 6 PM as usual then drove to John’s work to pick him up.

goodnight698,
goodnight293,
goodnight293,It’s been on and off for couple years now.
goodnight293,I haven’t really smoked in summer time and just got back to smoking again lately even since the weather got cold.
goodnight293,Last weekend, I hit the peak that I smoked a pack of cigarette on 3 days.
goodnight293,Although, it was holiday weekend, that was way too much and now I’m trying to cut it back.
goodnight293,I just had a dinner and am really craving for a cigarette now!
goodnight293,I might give up and just go to the grocery market across the street and get a pack.
goodnight293,However, I want to try as hard as I can to see how far I can make this go on.
goodnight293,It’s much easier in summer time that I can just go out for skating and I forget about cigarette lol.
goodnight293,Anyways, the first day of work in 2016 was just okay as last year.
goodnight293,Very calm and comfortable.
goodnight293,Work out on lunch break as usual and got off at 6.
goodnight293,Stopped by at grocery market around work before I head back to home.
goodnight293,Cooked chicken for dinner and writing a journal now.

goodnight372,Nothing special or interesting.
goodnight372,My job pays my bills and I go out on weekends.
goodnight372,Also do some stuffs on weekdays.
goodnight372,Nothing seems wrong.
goodnight372,Everything is just too fine and it gets me depressed.
goodnight372,Nothing serious but I just hate this feeling.
goodnight372,Whatever I try to do, I can’t get rid of this feeling.
goodnight372,It always comes right back in.
goodnight372,Maybe the cold weather makes me feel like it?
goodnight372,or am I being single for too long?
goodnight372,I don’t know.
goodnight372,I just don’t like this feeling.
goodnight372,
goodnight385,
goodnight385,It’s been a long time for me to write a journal here.
goodnight385,That means yeah I have been pretty lazy.
goodnight385,I have to admit.
goodnight385,Anyways, it was typical Tuesday.
goodnight385,Work till 6 PM work out with Peter on lunch break.
goodnight385,The traffic was okay after work so I got home about 20 mins earlier than usual.
goodnight385,Took a shower and went to quick shopping and dinner at Mariano’s.
goodnight385,Then I and John went to Mark and Craig’s birthday party at the bowling place on Western.
goodnight385,Met some new people and played bowling together till 11 PM.
goodnight385,It was pretty fun time.
goodnight385,Now I got back home and trying to wrap up the day.
goodnight385,Tomorrow, I have to work on freelance stuffs and it will take pretty much all my free time after work which is fine since I don’t have a lot going on lately.
goodnight385,I just have to get back to my own projects and find out how to improve my portfolio site.
goodnight385,I’m not sure what’s wrong with it but I know  it need something to attract people more.
goodnight385,For tonight, I will go to bed after this.

goodnight344,March/18/2015 11PM in CST, I updated new design on GoodnightJournal.com.
goodnight344,I wanted to make it more simple and easy to write/read journals.
goodnight344,I choose one column layout and removed all unnecessary stuffs out of the way.
goodnight344,So people can focus on writing and reading journals better.
goodnight344,Hope it helps for the users who write journals here.
goodnight344,FYI, this is the beginning of the making this site better.
goodnight344,There will be more small updates to make things work smoothly.
goodnight344,Please feel free to leave any comments or feedback on the comment section.
goodnight344,I would love to hear your thoughts and I will listen!
goodnight344,
goodnight286,
goodnight286,Just talked my mom and grand mom in Korea.
goodnight286,My grand mom had a surgery couple days ago and she’s finally going back to home from the hospital.
goodnight286,She does not sounds very good when I talked her on the phone.
goodnight286,Though she is definitely recovering from the surgery.
goodnight286,Hope it won’t be to hard for her to get back to normal.
goodnight286,My mom also did a lot to take care of her.
goodnight286,Although I’m not there to see but I can tell.
goodnight286,Maybe it’s about time for me to go see them again.
goodnight286,Had a pretty decent day today.
goodnight286,Nothing special to write about.
goodnight286,I’m just so glad it’s Thursday night  Seems like this weekend will be busy.
goodnight286,Going snowboarding and catching up with friends!
goodnight286,will be fun.
goodnight286,9:07 PM here in Chicago.
goodnight286,Feel already sleepy and I think I need some extra time for sleeping.
goodnight286,Since I stayed up late playing around with backing up this site.
goodnight286,It’s good that I finally figured out what to do and saw it worked!
goodnight286,Things are gonna go smooth now on 😉
goodnight286,Goodnight everyone!
goodnight286, 
goodnight286,
goodnight536,
goodnight536,I got my first test render for the video and it looks good so far.
goodnight536,It still needs a fine tuning but I will do that after I got my real footage which I will get on Thursday so everything is right on track I guess.
goodnight536,I had very typical day today except for that I kind of wanted to go out after work which I did not even try to.
goodnight536,Probably gonna watch a movie before the sleep.
goodnight536,anyways, good night everyone!
goodnight536,
goodnight646,
goodnight646,feel like my life is getting boring as the time goes.
goodnight646,do pretty much same things everyday and nothing seems interesting.
goodnight646,loosing motivations and my personal goals become blurry.
goodnight646,Maybe I need a vacation  thinking about adding most recent public journals and pics from public journals on main page cause the main page looks too plane to me.
goodnight646,tried to make couple different designs but it didn’t look that good so I guess I will keep work on it till I get the design that serves better for users.
goodnight646,Just in case sprout22 read this, I didn’t forget about the theme I’m constantly researching and thinking to find the best solution to implement that in GoodNightJournal.com 
goodnight646,Anyways, we all get depressed or frustrated sometimes in our life as I am right now.
goodnight646,However, I believe that we all need that to get better and be more thankful when the good day comes  
goodnight646,For me, just writing things in my mind makes me feel so much better & relieved than just keep thinking about it.
goodnight646,
goodnight384,
goodnight384,It’s been kind of busy Sunday.
goodnight384,Church in the morning and picnic in the afternoon with skating group that I love  The weather was beautiful and there were bunch of new people showed up for the first time.
goodnight384,We had really good time at the lake till almost 6 PM.
goodnight384,Now I’m trying to wrap up the week.
goodnight384,just finished writing journals for week and doing laundry.
goodnight384,Feel like I have a lot going on.
goodnight384,I really need to sit down and organize stuffs.
goodnight384,I will have to write it down by priority and do things one by one.
goodnight384,I guess my new freelance work will be the first thing that I have to finish up this week which I’m already working on it.
goodnight384,then spend some time with my personal projects that I have neglecting for a while.
goodnight384,I feel really guilty for that.
goodnight384,Things are still really mess in my head right now and I will try to organize them after I put my laundry to the dryer lol
goodnight384,I was talking a picture above and my friend took a picture of me taking that picture.
goodnight384,that’s what’s going on with pictures 
goodnight384,
goodnight614,
goodnight614,Got an message from Dustinee today about the suggestions on this site.
goodnight614,that made me realize that I haven’t forgot about the functionally side of the site.
goodnight614,I spent most of time focusing on user experience and design side and still working on new theme lol.
goodnight614,Now that Dustinee reminded me that, I will add those things on my to do list and try to get all of those functions on the site.
goodnight614,She suggested adding friends button and be able to manage it,

goodnight418,We had amazing day today in Chicago.
goodnight418,Almost 60 degrees and sunny.
goodnight418,So I decided to put on my skate and go out to lake after church.
goodnight418,First time this year felf so great to be skating around lake.
goodnight418,However, after a long break my body couldn’t keep up with my mind.
goodnight418,I had to take extra more breaks to get to the downtown took me about an hour to get there plun the wind blowing against me which made it way harder.
goodnight418,After hitting the downtown, I head back to home and in the middle of the road I saw my friend came out for skating too.
goodnight418,It was funny that I ran into them.
goodnight418,I tried to do more runs with them but had to give up cause I got cramp on both legs lol.
goodnight418,Took another hour to get back going really slow so I donlt get cramp cause it tend to happen consistently once I get it.
goodnight418,Anyways, it was good day.
goodnight418,Yeah summer is almost here!
goodnight418,Also I found a place that might work out for me just have to call them tomorrow to see it’s still available or not.
goodnight418,Sharing some pictures I took today.
goodnight418,Goodnight.
goodnight418,
goodnight430,
goodnight430,I always have questions for myself that why am I always thinking too much, Why can’t I just be satisfied for what I have right now and want more and more.
goodnight430,I keep asking myself but still don’t know why.
goodnight430,It’s just me and I just gotta keep going for what I want.
goodnight430,For doing that, I tend to be over stressed out.
goodnight430,Sometimes, it’s frustrating when you don’t get what you try for.
goodnight430,Despite knowing that, I just have to keep going and I know I never give up.
goodnight430,It will probably like this for a long time.
goodnight430,What do you think?
goodnight430,is this good way to live your life?
goodnight430,
goodnight484,

goodnight512,So I did not eat at all pretty much all day.
goodnight512,then my cousin wanted to have a BBQ for dinner so we did and I ate so much that I am having hard time breathing lol.

goodnight603,Surprisigliy It was so good does not taste like fast food at all.
goodnight603,Yeah it is very hard to believe that Wendy’s came out with real food 😀
goodnight603,Work was very boring today.
goodnight603,Came back to my normal schedule.
goodnight603,Walking around my neighborhood for a while.
goodnight603,Now I’m ready to go to sleep.
goodnight603,Will write my journal tmw.
goodnight603,
goodnight544,
goodnight544,Starting my day with deleting spams on the site like any other days.
goodnight544,the only difference is that I am still drunk.
goodnight544,spent almost hundred dollar for nothing last night but I had fun I guess.
goodnight544,
goodnight626,
goodnight626,I have been thinking about this quite a lot lately.
goodnight626,well I think about that all the time ever since I gave up my goal after graduation.
goodnight626,I guess my life has been kind of settled down in a boring way.
goodnight626,working full time make money for living go out on weekend so on so on... yeah I’m definitely missing something and I believe that is the goal that I need to pursue.
goodnight626,always saying and deciding to sit down and organize things, write down things I want in my future but I never really spent time to do all that.
goodnight626,these days I’m just spending time on this site beside going out spending money.
goodnight626,I want to get the goals like a year ago.
goodnight626,I want to be crazy for something.
goodnight626,I want to move forward.
goodnight626,this is not the place for me to settle down.
goodnight626,remember your journey is not even close to the end yet.
goodnight626,you still have long way to go and I am going to enjoy it.
goodnight626,
goodnight687,
goodnight687,I failed  couldn’t keep it up everyday.
goodnight687,It seems to me, it’s almost impossible.
goodnight687,However, I still write a journal whenever I have time n still agree with that writing something everyday is good.
goodnight687,Writing journal comes to me like leaving a traces to look back n gives me time to think about that, makes me come up with better plans for tmw.
goodnight687,I will finally have time to work on this site probably next week n I can’t wait!!
goodnight687,!
goodnight687,
goodnight588,
goodnight588,every time they release new update, I get nervous about GoodNightJournal that something might breaks up on my theme.
goodnight588,However, I want to keep it up to date so it performs faster and better security.
goodnight588,apparently, it works good with my theme on this site so far I tested.
goodnight588,anyways, enjoy journaling!
goodnight588,
goodnight361,

goodnight323,Work and home that I do everyday.
goodnight323,Gym on my lunch break and skating after work.
goodnight323,I got home around 6:50 PM and got out to skate around 7:00 PM then I encountered with a lady at the entrees of my apartment building who I know I met before but did not remember who she was.
goodnight323,She ended up recognized me first and we started talking.
goodnight323,She turned out to be John’s boss who came here to see what’s going on with him.
goodnight323,I just told her he moved out last month and let her know if I can get in touch with him.
goodnight323,It got me worried about him and he’s still not responding on my call or text.
goodnight323,I will wait till tomorrow have to check with his family.
goodnight323,It just weird tho that she came over here.
goodnight323,Something seems suspicious either her or John.
goodnight323,Just hoping he will be find and stay out of trouble.
goodnight323,It was a very hot day in Chicago.
goodnight323,Probably the hottest day/night in this years.
goodnight323,AC is on to cool me down and I’m just going though the stuff online.
goodnight323,I have to wake up early tomorrow for another opportunity who probably will freak out for the status thing like the others.
goodnight323,Well I just have to try tho.
goodnight323,So I’m going sleep little early tonight.
goodnight323,Goodnight and sweet dreams!
goodnight323,
goodnight275,
goodnight275,here in Chicago.
goodnight275,The weather has been pretty depressing for past couple months.
goodnight275,Well if you know the winter in Chicago but today, we had an unexpected beautiful day and of course I had to get out with my skate.
goodnight275,Too bad I woke up too late today after waking up at 6 in the morning and got back to sleep till 12:30 PM.
goodnight275,However, I spent rest of the day outside enjoying the weather with my favorite people.
goodnight275,I skated almost 17 miles today and practiced many tricks that I want to master this year 
goodnight275,Hopefully one day, I will share a video showing one of the tricks I have been practicing.
goodnight275,We hang out at Grant park and the field museum till the sun goes down then had lots of food and some drinks at Anton and Natalia’s place.
goodnight275,Yes, it was a lot of fun and I had a great time!
goodnight275,I skated back to home around 9 PM.
goodnight275,I just can’t wait for the summer!!!
goodnight275,It seems like I need to spend rest of my weekend to get my things done.
goodnight275,I really need to update my portfolio updated and work on the App design that I have been working on with my friend.
goodnight275,It’s 11:34 PM in Chicago.
goodnight275,Doing my laundry and spending time on GoodnightJournal.com.
goodnight275,PrettyinBlack really got me today.
goodnight275,I just love and so grateful to see her journal today and it really hit me to get more involved with this site.
goodnight275,It’s true that I have been very lazy writing journals here and read journals from others.
goodnight275,In fact, I’m not a big fan of reading in general but I know I need to read more and I will do it here.
goodnight275,I remember the time when I talked a lot with others maybe two years ago and it was a great memory!
goodnight275,I definitely want that again.
goodnight275,Many thanks to PrettyinBlack!
goodnight275,Hope all of you are having a great weekend!
goodnight275,Summer is on the way 😉
goodnight275,Pic – Taken from Grant Park Chicago.
goodnight275,
goodnight349,
goodnight349,So I started again working on new design for GoodnightJournal today.
goodnight349,Well I have been thinking about it for months and actually took a first step couple weeks ago but I have been kind of busy lately and did not have time to work on it.
goodnight349,Today, I got some time to go back and restart where I stopped.
goodnight349,I actually got some progress today and it got me very excited.
goodnight349,It will have much simple interface which will make writing way easier.
goodnight349,Got my new font selected and got main layout done almost!
goodnight349,Just little worry about the new functions that I want to implement on new design.
goodnight349,Hopefully it won’t take that long.
goodnight349,It will still need some time for me to launch it but I just can’t wait to talk about it!
goodnight349,Can’t wait to show it to everyone!
goodnight349,I just gotta work my ass off 
goodnight349,
goodnight548,
goodnight548,Feel tired all day.
goodnight548,Back home from the work about 20 mins ago n trying to go to sleep now.
goodnight548,Expecting to be waking up at tmw morning with full of energy!
goodnight548,
goodnight455,
goodnight455,It’s been like a week that I’m like so close to the end but can’t figure it out the one thing that is critical to the site.
goodnight455,Still excited about the new project that I have been working on for weeks but at the same time I get frustrated pretty much everyday for that one thing I really need.
goodnight455,I wish I knew more programming so I can just write my own code.
goodnight455,Tonight, I tried couple different ways to solve the problem but nothing worked out.
goodnight455,more research needed and maybe I need complete new structure.
goodnight455,I don’t know right now; I’m just too burned out, can’t think clearly after sitting at computer for like 14 hours lol.
goodnight455,
goodnight683,
goodnight683,started working on another website today!
goodnight683,I actually bought a domain 2 months ago but could not have time to work on that so far.
goodnight683,Today, I spent all my day working on that site hoping to get it done by today.
goodnight683,it’s over midnight rignt now and I still have to fix so many things on that site.
goodnight683,lol much more work than I expected.
goodnight683,I guess, it needs at least a week to open beta service.
goodnight683,I couldn’t even watch the walking dead tonight cause of this  and now I need to go to sleep for work tmw.
goodnight683,well at least I did something productive over the weekend 
goodnight683,
goodnight278,
goodnight278,Working on SkateChicago.org for past couple days and I finally pushed it to live today.
goodnight278,It’s not quite ready yet but good enough to share it with friends who are working on this skating event in Chicago and improve it for the big announcement.
goodnight278,I did not have enough time to work this the way I usually do.
goodnight278,Just spent 3 days to make this from scratch except for the back-end lol of course.
goodnight278,Despite the time I spent, it came out pretty good at least in my perspective.
goodnight278,I like the logo!
goodnight278,I think it conveys the exciting/fun skating event and the city of Chicago.
goodnight278,Still gotta do lots of work to get this going but I’m very excited to work this together with my favorite people.
goodnight278,Can’t wait till June to actually see this happen!
goodnight278,More update about this will come here 
goodnight278, 
goodnight278,
goodnight592,
goodnight592,woke up at 3:30AM n can’t go back to sleep, decided to work on updating sites that I have procrastinated.
goodnight592,It will probably going to take couple hours to get done or might be longer if something goes wrong.
goodnight592,now time to work!
goodnight592,just sharing some of works I have done!
goodnight592,
goodnight577,
goodnight577,This is what I got from googling the most beautiful place.

goodnight577,so it says The Iguazu waterfalls.At the border of Argentina and Brazil.
goodnight577,looks pretty cool.
goodnight577,the weather is getting little bit cooler but still hot.

goodnight456,
goodnight390,
goodnight390,to write a journal here.
goodnight390,the same thing that I have been saying that yeah I have been very lazy for this.
goodnight390,Although nothing really going on with my life, I kind of feel like busy and tired all the time.
goodnight390,Also feel like missing something really important in my life and don’t really know what it is?
goodnight390,Am I getting lonely for being myself for too long?
goodnight390,do I need a girl friend?
goodnight390,do I need a new job?
goodnight390,or a new fresh project to work on?
goodnight390,I don’t know.
goodnight390,it’s just something that I’m not quite satisfied about my life...
goodnight390,It’s 6 AM on Tuesday.
goodnight390,I got up so early today by no reason.
goodnight390,cause I went sleep before midnight?
goodnight390,or my body wants to do something in the morning before I go to work?
goodnight390,Anyways, I’m fully awake now and probably not going to go back to sleep.
goodnight390,It’s got little cold here in Chicago which makes me think that summer is going away.
goodnight390,Time goes by fast and I’m not getting things that I want which makes me little nervous and uneasy.
goodnight390,
goodnight710,
goodnight710,Still trying to solve the problem with Facebook like button.
goodnight710,Did lots of searches but didn’t see any solutions.
goodnight710,Seems like I’m the one of the very few people who’s having the same problem which is bad luck for me cause there aren’t that many resources for that issue.
goodnight710,Well, I will keep looking tomorrow.
goodnight710,Little tired now.
goodnight710,Had some beer with friends over dinner n I guess that made me sleepy.
goodnight710,So good night!

goodnight510,It was just crazy I got burned out after work.
goodnight510,Asked my friend to go to buffet restaurant to release all the stress I got from work by eating.
goodnight510,Well I don’t mine being busy at work; I actually prefer to be busy.
goodnight510,However, I don’t feel like I am doing something that matters, I just want to do things that matters.
goodnight510,If you know what I mean.

goodnight377,He’s only 24 or 25 years old and he’s dying from cancer.
goodnight377,I felt really bad to see him yesterday night and didn’t really know what to say.
goodnight377,Things that I normally say to my friends is not really make sense to hime cause I might not see him ever again.
goodnight377,Colin texted me about that and we decided to go with Eddie and Ken.

goodnight332,As I use more and more on real life projects, I noticed more that I need to understand basics of it.
goodnight332,Understanding the basics will help me build better products in the future.
goodnight332,This will take some time and effort.

goodnight311,It also means my work visa will be expired in an year too and I’m still not sure what I want to do.
goodnight311,Well it’s more likely I haven’t got things I have been wanting to have.

goodnight295,Big thank you to Anton who pretty much walked me through setting up new server for twice and all the amazing people in WordPress community and Stack Overflow who helped me out with bunch of programing issues.
goodnight295,There are still lots of things to improve but I’m so glad I just took the first step for doing all that.
goodnight295,I was able to build my own plugin for the main feature of site which will allow me to design the site with more flexibility.
goodnight295,I’m very excited for the improvement that I will make and see how people will interact with it.
goodnight295,It was probably the one of the best Christmas I ever had in my life.

goodnight655,Don’t really have anything to write.
goodnight655,hopefully, I woke up on time tmw for church that I couldn’t make last week.
goodnight655,still have many thoughts in my head, try to forget all about it by making myself busy....
goodnight655,everything will be fine.
goodnight655,My experience in Cali, made me realize that life is NOT always go as I expected or planned.
goodnight655,Although I am fully aware of that, I still think I need plans and a full of expectation for the future and most importantly actually do it whatever I have in my mind.
goodnight655,
goodnight348,
goodnight348,So my apartment lease is gonna be end in a month and I have to decided in a week whether if I want to renew or not.
goodnight348,I’m still not quite sure what I want to do with it.
goodnight348,I do have a decent apartment at good location with very good price and my landlord is willing to give me a discount if I renew the lease.
goodnight348,However, I’m not very satisfied with my current living situation.
goodnight348,Not thing wrong with it.
goodnight348,There are just little things that bother me little bit.
goodnight348,Things like me spending all the money for kitchen supplies and cleaning apartment myself when my roommate were out of town for work and he coming up with excuses for not doing anything  due to the vacancy he has for work.
goodnight348,It was okay first and time goes by this starting to bother me little lol.
goodnight348,I guess I just don’t want to have extra thing that I have to take care of...
goodnight348,Since my roommate is my cousin, I’m more than willing to help him out as much as I can.
goodnight348,I think I’m gonna see if he’s gonna be good for affording apartment by himself first and make plan accordingly.
goodnight348,Still have a week to think about so I’m good for now.
goodnight348,Today I got up around 7 AM to drop off my little cousin at airport.
goodnight348,Back home, doing laundry and had breakfast myself.
goodnight348,It’s only 9:41AM now.

goodnight318,You probably noticed already if u r reading this that public journal page is loading very slow.
goodnight318,This is because I’m working on this page.
goodnight318,There was a change in public journal page that it only shows one latest journal entry from each author in the site.
goodnight318,This will prevent seeing bunch of journal entries from one author.
goodnight318,I’m still working on this page to load faster and it is taking longer than I expected.
goodnight318,I’m trying to get this done within this weekend.
goodnight318,Please be patience till then.

goodnight325,I’m also not gonna be lazy for improving myself and my skill sets.
goodnight325,It’s just a thing I need to do till I die.
goodnight325,Got many thoughts on my head now and I’m just trying to writing down things as it pops up in my head.

goodnight504,
goodnight504,Up at 9:30 gave a ride to john, work out in the gym.
goodnight504,Back home went on inline skating for over an hour.
goodnight504,It probably was not a good idea to do that in this weather and I fell down once.
goodnight504,Luckly it was not that bad.
goodnight504,Back home around 3 cleaned up my apartment while I was doin laundry.
goodnight504,After that, just seating on my couch watching TV all day.
goodnight504,This is way too peaceful for me which got me so bored...
goodnight504,
goodnight387,
goodnight387,Lately, I always feel like I got bunch of things to get done and did not really know what to do or where to start.
goodnight387,I kind of feel like that it’s programed in my brain that I’m busy that I got things to do.
goodnight387,Well yes I do and I do all the things that needs to be done but I don’t have to be push my self and stressed down about that.
goodnight387,I guess I need to learn the way to enjoy my life and do things that needs to be done.
goodnight387,It’s always been my problem that when one thing gets in my head, I can get rid of it till I solve that issue or remove the problem.
goodnight387,I need to give myself a room to breath and be calm.
goodnight387,Today, I spent most of my free time working on the freelance project that I have been thinking of all day.
goodnight387,It feels really good to get things done but just hated the time that I was worrying about it all day.
goodnight387,I always wanna move forward, make myself better and get things that I want.
goodnight387,For doing that, I think I push myself way too much in a very not productive way.
goodnight387,As I always say, I need to sit down and take a time to think back and organize stuffs.
goodnight387,It does not seem like a lot going on rest of the week.
goodnight387,Hopefully, I will have the time for that.
goodnight387,Just wrote my messy thoughts and yes it is messy...
goodnight387,
goodnight477,
goodnight477,I took a day off today for the dentist but it got messed up now.
goodnight477,My insurance company has this stupid waiting period thing that I can only get benefits after an year of sign up day which will be Sep/1/14.
goodnight477,So I have to go talk to HR tmw to find out what I can do.
goodnight477,Also had a car wash for thr first time since I got a new car.
goodnight477,After the car wash I realized that I need to take care of my car almost 6 momths of abandonment really messed up my car paint.
goodnight477,Stopped by downtown for quick shipping and will go ice skating in Lincoln park zoo(pic above) in a min.
goodnight477,So we got one more day left for 2013.
goodnight477,How should I spend the last day productively or memorably?
goodnight477,
goodnight436,
goodnight436,I dont know I don’t really feel happy lately.
goodnight436,Just keep worrying about something and lost lot of self-esteem.
goodnight436,Why is this happenning to me.
goodnight436,I just don’t want to do anything today.
goodnight436,Didn’t really do anything after work.
goodnight436,I will just gonna take a rest till I get back to normal.
goodnight436,I want my energy back and all those motivations!
goodnight436,!

goodnight621,I just noticed that I been missing lots of days for writing journal.
goodnight621,only see 3 entries in May lol.
goodnight621,this is horrible.
goodnight621,I wanted to write every day journal in 2013 and apparently it’s impossible to do that now.
goodnight621,one of another typical day for me.
goodnight621,went to graphic designer meeting after work.
goodnight621,got some good information about freelancing since I want to get some freelance work, I guess it was good decision to go there.

goodnight621,added recent public journal entries and public images on the main page.
goodnight621,will work on style tmw.

goodnight475,So it’s been snowing crazy for 2 days and it finally stopped at around 9:30.
goodnight475,I got out to shovel the snow n noticed my neighbor shoveled snow toward to front of my car.
goodnight475,I couldn’t take a pic of before I shoveled snow around my car cause I did not bring my phone at first time but my car’s front was basically all buried in the snow that my neighbor dumped.
goodnight475,Thanks to my neighbor for giving me extra time to work out by shoveling snow.
goodnight475,Spent about 30 mins to get my car out of the snow so I can just drive away tmw morning for work.
goodnight475,I was thinking about dumping back all the snow plus more snow to my neighbor’s spot but I did not do that cause I don’t want to be an asshole.
goodnight475,However, looking at his spot that how clean he shoveled his spot gets me wanna be a selfish like him.
goodnight475,
goodnight427,
goodnight427,Yay it’s Friday night and I’m having a very peaceful time now myself at home.
goodnight427,Did things I haven’t done for a week.
goodnight427,Enjoying time that I don’t really have to do or have to go anywhere.
goodnight427,Well I got things to do but noting urgent and I can take time to take a break for a night.
goodnight427,Feels like its been a while that I have these kind of time myself.
goodnight427,I’m already on my bed now.
goodnight427,Don’t really want to do anything and I love it.
goodnight427,Have a great weekend everyone
goodnight427,
goodnight665,
goodnight665,Some reason even though I started write a journal online, I can’t just ignore my journals on notebook which I have been keeping for about 7 years.
goodnight665,So I’m writing journals on my notebook with a pen and here at GoodNightJournal.com  Today, I got sometime to organize things at home myself and now it’s time to be productive.
goodnight665,

goodnight615,Goodnight!
goodnight615,Good journaling!
goodnight615,
goodnight355,
goodnight355,Because it’s been a while for me to write journal here.
goodnight355,Yes, I have been very lazy lately.
goodnight355,Well, it seems like I have been saying that for every single time I write journal for past couple months.
goodnight355,I feel shame on me for that lol.
goodnight355,Not much going on with my life just same things as usual.
goodnight355,Trying to spend more time on new project that I started months ago and it is finally coming out okay.
goodnight355,It still needs more work but I think it is good to share now with you guys here at goodnightjournal.
goodnight355,So my new project was creating a site for online shopping websites, where you can find online shops, share online shops you like and review them to help others to find ones they need.
goodnight355,As I said, there are many more things have to be done but you are more than welcome to come by and check out the site.
goodnight355,It is www.othoo.com

goodnight593,
goodnight593,some reason I get little depressed on Sunday night.
goodnight593,couldn’t really focus on anything all day.
goodnight593,skipped the church & meeting instead stayed at my apartment all day long watching Netflix.
goodnight593,gotta get back to work but don’t feel like it.
goodnight593,
goodnight565,
goodnight565,I had 12 hours of sleep last night.
goodnight565,woke up at 7:30 AM felt so much better than past couple days.
goodnight565,I didn’t feel tired at all for entire day and started work out again.
goodnight565,I started working on animation on my video.
goodnight565,Today, I got intro and ending done with whole layout for almost 2 min video.
goodnight565,The hardest part comes now all the animation in the middle will probably take me at least full two days to get done.
goodnight565,Also talked the my old boss at the tv station to get the permission to use studio for the video.
goodnight565,ended up exchanging with helping him out something on Saturday.
goodnight565,So I guess I will be able to get the footage on next Saturday and finish up the whole video on Sunday if I get all the animation done before next Saturday.
goodnight565,Seems like I have a lot of time.
goodnight565,for doing this, I kind of have to hold off other projects.
goodnight565,Since I posted a post for hiring a partner for ParkMartini today, I will probably wait till I get my video done and see if I get any response on that post.
goodnight565,well too much thoughts lol
goodnight565,

goodnight279,Don’t really feel like I get enough time to do something after work on weekdays.
goodnight279,It will be nice to have flexible work time that I actually believe in to be more productive for employer and employees.
goodnight279,Hopefully, I get that one day!
goodnight279,Feel kind of sleepy already and not sure if I want to mess around with backup thing now or not.

goodnight315,At least I know he’s good.
goodnight315,Not too much projects at work and work out on lunch break.
goodnight315,The weather was great which made me go out for skating after work despite the strong wind.
goodnight315,Skating down to South was amazing.
goodnight315,I felt like I was almost flying with pushing my back.
goodnight315,However, on the way back to North was kind of pain in the ass.
goodnight315,I just took my time to come back.
goodnight315,I could tell tho, my endurance got much better than before.
goodnight315,Stopped by at Jewel to grab something to cook.
goodnight315,Ended up buying steak and cooked it all for tonight and tomorrow’s lunch and maybe more.

goodnight315,While I was doing it I found out that I learned a lot for doing that.
goodnight315,I should utilize some of my free time to do the theme review.

goodnight426,Today, I woke up at 7 in the morning and got church at 8 am to help Eddi moving from South West suburb to North side of Chicago.
goodnight426,I always like helping people out so I decided to spend my Saturday helping him moving.
goodnight426,there were 3 other people came to help.
goodnight426,We drove an hour to get there load everything to truck and unload everything back at the high rise apartment in Lakeview.
goodnight426,Long story short it was fun to meet new people and feels good to be able to helping someone out but I just got too tired lol.
goodnight426,Finished everything got back home right before 5pm.
goodnight426,All I want right now is just stay  at home maybe watch some tv and have a long sleep lol I probably have to move too end of April and I don’t really know if I want to do it or not.
goodnight426,
goodnight443,
goodnight443,I still don’t really know what’s going on but I see lots of social feeds talking about figure skating today at Sochi Olympic.
goodnight443,So people are saying there were miss judgement on final event which gave most famous Korean skater Yuna Kim a silver medal instead of gold.
goodnight443,Yes when Korea people get angry they make a website down.
goodnight443,For this time, petition for re-evaluation.
goodnight443,pretty cool isn’t it?
goodnight443,I wish she won the gold medal but it’s already finalized and I don’t think it’s gonna be changed.
goodnight443,Anyways, I had very typical day as usual.
goodnight443,It was raining all day in Chicago over 40 degrees all day.
goodnight443,just one more days to go before the weekend!
goodnight443,I don’t know why but seems like my apartment management office has very bad system for keeping the record.
goodnight443,My building owner called me yesterday and said I did not pay security deposit and last month rent which I did.
goodnight443,So today I have to take pictures of all those receipts and email them to him.
goodnight443,Don’t really like extra works like that.
goodnight443,Well just wanted to write it down what happened today.
goodnight443,working on parkMartini for the cool concept called “Random Shot” check it out 
goodnight443,http://parkmartini.com/random-shot/

goodnight428,
goodnight639,
goodnight639,I tend to get depressed little bit but on Sunday night by no reason.
goodnight639,It just happens whenever I stay home on Sunday night like today.
goodnight639,Well I watched some movies n had some drinks myself n now I’m tired enough to go to sleep.
goodnight639,I don’t know y I get depressed on Sunday night.
goodnight639,I should be or want to be excited for the beginning of new week like when I was in Cali.
goodnight639,
goodnight538,
goodnight538,Finally it came.
goodnight538,Instead of hating it, I decided to enjoy this freezing weather.
goodnight538,have a good day everyone!
goodnight538,
goodnight339,
goodnight339,I realized today that the more I see things, the more I want.
goodnight339,All those nice things out there... Better Apartment, better neighborhood, better lifestyle well not too much about nicer cars but all those things make me want them so bad.
goodnight339,I guess I just want to be at the better position in my life which I always wanted.
goodnight339,I have the goals in my life but it doesn’t seem like I’m achieving any of those for past couple years.
goodnight339,All those trying and waiting got me frustrated sometimes like today.
goodnight339,Although I know I won’t give up trying, I can’t just ignore these feelings.
goodnight339,I’m thinking and waiting every single moments to get something better and hope that’s gonna happen soon.
goodnight339,Maybe I’m driving to wrong direction or does not have the right car that can speed up on my expectation.
goodnight339,However, I can’t really tell what went wrong or it’s just taking really long time.
goodnight339,Well, what am I missing here?
goodnight339,
goodnight496,
goodnight496,I have been eating crazy from last night.
goodnight496,All I did today was eating and sleeping all day long.
goodnight496,My apartment smells like meat I need to slow down little bit 
goodnight496,
goodnight485,
goodnight485,It was just one of other days that I do my things.
goodnight485,Work till 6 PM, gym on my lunch break, drove an hour to get back to home, dinner myself and writing a journal online.
goodnight485,trying to think something to write but can’t think of anything cause it was just same day as usual days.
goodnight485,At least I did not have a bad day lol how was your day?
goodnight485,
goodnight365,
goodnight365,It’s been a long time that I’m writing diary here.
goodnight365,Well that makes me feel really lazy.
goodnight365,I don’t know that I have been being lazy or not.
goodnight365,It feels like I have a lot going on lately.
goodnight365,New website project that I have been working on and lots of thoughts in my head kind of drive me crazy.
goodnight365,However, still it just doesn’t make sense for me to skip writing diary for this long.
goodnight365,Now that I’m writing things down, I kind of realize how I spent my free time lately and it was very unproductive.
goodnight365,At some point, my goal has become blurry and I kind of forgetting where my destination is in my life.
goodnight365,It seems like I just kept thinking about same daily routine of my life and get bored on that instead of preparing and building things for my future.
goodnight365,I really need to get back on the track and get motivated again for myself and my loved ones.
goodnight365,I gotta stop wasting time and start doing things that benefits for my future.
goodnight365,I guess I start with my new project Othoo.com.
goodnight365,Full launch by first day of November/2014.
goodnight365,Get at least 10 online shops under each category and of course get all the necessary functionally done.
goodnight365,As I more work on this, I get the feeling that this will work if I build&maintain it right.
goodnight365,So yeah Let’s do this.

goodnight406,I was worried about raining but it wasn’t rain enough to cancel the skating.
goodnight406,We got 25 people gathered up at Daley Center and skated around city for 2 hours.
goodnight406,It was crazy fun.
goodnight406,Skating makes me feel good and skating with people in the city makes me feel even better.
goodnight406,We had a lot of fun skating around city for 10 miles.
goodnight406,I also got to visit Pilson that I have never been.
goodnight406,The new restaurant was okay that giving out lots of nuts.

goodnight316,Today, I listened a podcast had a Black Obama as a guest and just wanted to point out that he kept personal journals for about 7 or 10?
goodnight316,years.
goodnight316,He said that sometime he read through them and found himself not much different than 20 years ago which is interesting to me.
goodnight316,I have been keeping journals from 2006(I believe lol) but have not really read though my old journals and don’t really feel like read them at this moment.
goodnight316,Maybe later when I feel like go back and read them, I can share how I feel about it.

goodnight417,I decided to go on a skate with a short sleeve t-shirt in 30 something degrees weather.
goodnight417,I skated down to Lincoln park from where I leave and it took about an hour to get there.
goodnight417,Right after I got to my friend place, I started having runny nose.

goodnight440,It’s taking longer than I expected and I still have no solution on the problem.
goodnight440,I went to the WP meeting last night with hope that I find someone who can help me with programming.
goodnight440,I talked most of people there got one guy who might be able to help me out with the issue.
goodnight440,I was trying to define problem to him then I realized that not even myself know exactly what is the problem that holding me down.
goodnight440,So I failed to explain that to me but got his card has email address on it.
goodnight440,From last night, I tried to find the problem that I can ask him to advice but It’s still not clear to me.
goodnight440,I’m just struggling now.
goodnight440,Maybe I need to get away from this for little bit to get refreshed.
goodnight440,Well tonight, I just gonna watch Jimmy Kimmel Live.
goodnight440,
goodnight489,
goodnight489,It’s snowing again here in Chicago n it’s been accumulated over 5 inches I believe.
goodnight489,I did enjoyed it yesterday when I didn’t have to go to work but today it was kind of pain in the ass to shovel all those snow around my car to go to work.
goodnight489,I wish I’m in ski resort now.
goodnight489,Went to see my dentist today to get cleaning but she refused to do it cause of my cold sore n gave me an orniment for it.

goodnight414,I had really hard time wake up today.
goodnight414,Weird cause I went to bed around 9:30PM last night and it’s 3 hours earlier than usual.
goodnight414,Maybe my body got so lazy over the weekend because all I did on last weekend was stating at home and being lazy.
goodnight414,Hopefully, something exciting thing happens this weekend.
goodnight414,I have realized that too much expectation tend to gives me huge disappointment but right amount of expectation gets me going with motivation and productivity.

goodnight643,it was horrible incident over at Boston today.
goodnight643,I did not really follow up with what exactly happened there but I heard few people died and many people injured.
goodnight643,it’s just horrible n I can’t understand at all for the people who does this kind of things.
goodnight643,well due to my short English, I quoted the last sentence of my today’s journal entry  from (Jen Floyd Engel).
goodnight643,Dear God.
goodnight643,Comfort the victims.
goodnight643,And convict the rest of us to be the change we want to see in the world.

goodnight284,I don’t have any plans for rest of the night.
goodnight284,Maybe I will watch a movie or keep playing around with setting up local server.
goodnight284,I found it very amusing for me to mess around.
goodnight284,I don’t want to get too deep into it but wanna be able to set up my own server like Anton did for me.
goodnight284,Definitely one thing that I have to keep dig into!
goodnight284,I also have to talk Angela for the Adwords for this site that I’m really curious what result I will get from it.

goodnight392,We had World cup theme Road Rave last night and it was fun as usual.
goodnight392,Some reason tho everyone got really tired after the skating.
goodnight392,We were assuming if was the very moisturized weather but no one really knows.

goodnight392,
goodnight447,
goodnight447,Another week has began.
goodnight447,I felt like going work after the long vacation cause of the short snowboard trip.
goodnight447,Maybe I need a real vacation so I don’t feel like that for the one day trip to Wisconsin.
goodnight447,It was snowing in the morning but went away in couple hours and the weather was still freaking cold.
goodnight447,I still feel little tired and I don’t think I was on a condition that I usually have on normal days.
goodnight447,just need one more day to recover.
goodnight447,Drive right back to home after work.
goodnight447,traffic was beautiful hope it’s like today everyday.

goodnight572,website, probably the way I should go but still do not have anything I need.
goodnight572,always thinking about it but too lazy to actually do something about it.
goodnight572,for past couple days, I had been very lazy and I don’t like it at all.
goodnight572,Even though, I know that I have to keep going and put more time on my projects, it is so hard to do that.
goodnight572,most of time, I ended up just going out instead or watch movie and sleep.
goodnight572,How can I be motivated again.

goodnight345,I feel like I live with a full of expectations everyday.
goodnight345,It does not mean I just expect something.
goodnight345,I expect something that I have been putting my time for, something I have been trying for.
goodnight345,It feels kind of like waiting for the test result that I took yesterday.
goodnight345,Full of expectation gets me going but sometime gets me little frustrated when I don’t get the result I want.
goodnight345,Maybe it is just my life that I try something to get what I want and waiting with expectations.
goodnight345,What expectations you have on your daily life?
goodnight345,
goodnight578,
goodnight578,Godaddy put me on the old server till now cause I signed up like 5 years ago.
goodnight578,So they just kept me on the server that I had when I signed up which made my sites very unstable.
goodnight578,Now I requested to move everything to new server n hopefully it will solve the load speed issue.
goodnight578,Can’t believe they just left me on the old server cause I have been a customer for long time?!?!

goodnight287,My diary for January/02/2016
goodnight287,The second day of 2016.
goodnight287,It was freezing below 32 degree weather but the sun was out all day.
goodnight287,I had to go out with my skate on since the sun is out.
goodnight287,However, low temperature made it harder to skate plus the wind.
goodnight287,I skated for 9.9 miles along the lake.
goodnight287,Although it was freezing and my skating muscles are hibernating, it was a lot of fun.
goodnight287,I don’t know if I can live without this.
goodnight287,I finally had a good and long sleep today.
goodnight287,I woke up after 1 PM and went out for skating.
goodnight287,Back home around 3:30 then headed out to Everybody’s coffee again with my laptop.
goodnight287,I stopped by here to grab Chai latte when I got out for skating.
goodnight287,I have been here for over 3 hours now and got a lot done.
goodnight287,My plugin update, entering skating events to othoo.com, got dates for Chicago skating and updating content on GoodnightJournal.com.
goodnight287,I still need to do backup on this site and I’m not sure if I’m gonna feel like doing it tonight when I get home but this has to be done soon.
goodnight287,6:34 PM and it’s dark outside already.
goodnight287,No plans for rest of the day.
goodnight287,I will probably take off soon to home and grab something for dinner on the way.

goodnight669,‘When my grandmother got arthritis , she couldn’t bend over and paint her toenails anymore..

goodnight669,That’s love.’

goodnight669,Danny – age 7
goodnight669,‘Love is when you kiss all the time.
goodnight669,Then when you get tired of kissing , you still want to be together and you talk more.
goodnight669,My Mommy and Daddy are like that.
goodnight669,They look gross when they kiss’ 
goodnight669,Emily – age 8
goodnight669,‘Love is what’s in the room with you at Christmas if you stop opening presents
goodnight669,And listen.’ 
goodnight669,Bobby – age 7 (Wow!)

goodnight669,Tommy – age 6
goodnight669,‘During my piano recital , I was on a stage and I was scared.

goodnight669,Mary Ann – age 4
goodnight669,‘I know my older sister loves me because she gives me all her old clothes and has to go out and buy new ones.’

goodnight669,Jessica – age 8
goodnight669,And the final one
goodnight669,The winner was a four year old child whose next door neighbor was an elderly gentleman who had recently lost his wife.
goodnight669,Upon seeing the man cry , the little boy went into the old gentleman’s yard , climbed onto his lap , and just sat there..
goodnight669,When his Mother asked what he had said to the neighbor , the little boy said ,
goodnight669,‘Nothing , I just helped him cry’ 
goodnight669,When there is nothing left but God , that is when you find out that God is all you need.
goodnight669,Take 60 seconds and give this a shot!
goodnight669,All you do is simply say the following small prayer for the person who sent you this.
goodnight669,Heavenly Father , please bless all my friends in whatever it is that You know they may be needing this day!
goodnight669,And may their life be full of Your peace , prosperity and power as he/she seeks to have a closer relationship with You.
goodnight669,Amen .
goodnight669,Then send it on to five other people , Within hours you caused a multitude of people to pray for other people.
goodnight669,Then sit back and watch the power of God work in your life.
goodnight669,P. S. Five is good , but more is better..
goodnight669,God Bless You!
goodnight669,Thank you to Olga for sharing this with me:)

goodnight619,
goodnight619,I believe it’s very important to keep your promises.
goodnight619,some people just keep breaking promises like nothing and insist they didn’t do anything wrong.
goodnight619,that’s just so wrong it means they don’t respect others at all.
goodnight619,hope people know that it’s very important to make a promises then actually keeping it because you should not make a promises if you can’t keep it.
goodnight619,I understand there are some circumstances that you can’t keep it.
goodnight619,However, you can’t let that happen over and over again.
goodnight619,you will just become a faithless person if you do that.
goodnight619,how about start with saying sorry when you couldn’t keep the promises you made instead of saying bullshits.
goodnight619,
goodnight517,
goodnight517,I kind of have been taking pics all day as I go places and want to share it with all of you.
