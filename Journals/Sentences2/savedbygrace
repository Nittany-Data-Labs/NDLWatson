goodnight39,
goodnight39,It is so cold today.
goodnight39,We have had to stay inside mostly just to keep warm.
goodnight39,But it’s been quiet and nice.
goodnight39,I am going to bed early (“early” even for me!)
goodnight39,I hope the phone doesn’t jar me awake like this morning.
goodnight39,Ah, well.
goodnight39,I am thinking of posting some of my poems.
goodnight39,I wonder if anyone would read them, hm?
goodnight39,
t night.
goodnight23,I wrote a song about it:
goodnight23,I will meet You in the morning
goodnight23,at the first light of the day.
goodnight23,We will walk together in Your garden,
goodnight23,Lord, I come to pray.
goodnight23,I will meet You
goodnight23,In the evening,
goodnight23,at the soft close of the day.
goodnight23,We will walk together in Your garden,
goodnight23,Lord, I come to pray.
goodnight23,
