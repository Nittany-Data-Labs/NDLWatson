goodnight272,I finished watching Turbo Kid with my â€œfriendâ€, MichaeÌˆl.
goodnight272,I was surprised how I love this funny quirky movie!
goodnight272,He recommended for us to watch it but I was highly skeptical of his choice because sci-fi comedy is not really my thing.
goodnight272,I was wrong :).
goodnight272,Just some minutes ago, we talked about it and told each others goodnight.
goodnight272,For tonight, Iâ€™m a happy girl even if I felt some sort of shitty hours ago.
goodnight272,He knows how to make me feel definitely better and the fact that he was smiling because I wanted to watch a movie with him is priceless.
goodnight272,Our days together will be over in 2 weeks because he will return to work at nights everyday after a car crash that left him temporarily injured.
goodnight272,Iâ€™m glad heâ€™s alive and heâ€™s feeling better each day ğŸ˜€ <3
goodnight272,
€™m reviewing my own thoughts.
