moya221993,goodnight272,I finished watching Turbo Kid with my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù, MichaeÃàl.
moya221993,goodnight272,I was surprised how I love this funny quirky movie!
moya221993,goodnight272,He recommended for us to watch it but I was highly skeptical of his choice because sci-fi comedy is not really my thing.
moya221993,goodnight272,I was wrong :).
moya221993,goodnight272,Just some minutes ago, we talked about it and told each others goodnight.
moya221993,goodnight272,For tonight, I‚Äôm a happy girl even if I felt some sort of shitty hours ago.
moya221993,goodnight272,He knows how to make me feel definitely better and the fact that he was smiling because I wanted to watch a movie with him is priceless.
moya221993,goodnight272,Our days together will be over in 2 weeks because he will return to work at nights everyday after a car crash that left him temporarily injured.
moya221993,goodnight272,I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs alive and he‚Äôs feeling better each day üòÄ <3
