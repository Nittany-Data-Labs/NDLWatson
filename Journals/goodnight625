First of all, I want to say thank you everyone for all your supports.
Since I lunched site on Jan/1/2013, it’s growing really fast which actually surprised me.
as we are getting more users and more traffic, it slowed down the website load speed little bit.
I finally found solution to make it faster after researching for two days.
It’s way faster now and no delays before the page loads.
I’m still trying to make it even faster to make sure you don’t waste time while you’re journaling
