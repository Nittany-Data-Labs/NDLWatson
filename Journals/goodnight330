It was a very humid day in Chicago.
I had a very typical Sunday.
Church, laundry, journals and watching the game of throne with friends.
Also had huge lunch with John at sushi para.
It is 12:16 AM now and I am ready to sleep.
Just spend about an hour to going through new opportunities and try to see what I can get.
Now I’m recharged and ready to run again.
Let’s go till I get it!
Goodnight everyone
