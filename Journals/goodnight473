Iâ€™m staying home tonight.
My friends came over earlier today and made Thai curry for late lunch.
Since I love Thai curry, I was maybe expecting too much on that and ended up disappointing cause it did not have the taste that I expected.
It had completely different taste from the ones I had in the Thai restaurant lol.
It was not that bed but failed to fill up my expectation.
My cold sore is almost gone just need couple more days to hill up.
Thinking about a new project to spend my free time.
well I kind of started working on it.
I will write more detail about it when I get a solid concept.
hope all of you have good Saturday night!
