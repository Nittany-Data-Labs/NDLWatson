It’s been like this for a week!
I feel like I have so many thoughts in my head and still not sure what’s the answer.
It can be very excited or very sad.
It will be all clear in a month or two but I know till then I won’t be able to get rid of all these thoughts.
Life is so unexpected even after all theses plans.
I guess I will just have to find the best way for me to go and try my best at the moment.
For now tho, I just wanna forget about everything and be relaxed.
