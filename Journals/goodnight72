I hate you.
I hate you for all the times you abused me and made me out to be the crazy one when I started to cry.
I hate the broken bones and bruises.
I hate your lies.
Your so selfish it makes me sick.
I hate how you never listen to me.
I hate when I poor my heart out to you and you say “what’s your point?”
   I should let you go.
I should have left you long ago.
I never turned you in when I should have.
Instead I lie and say I fell down the stairs.
I defend you  “it was really all my fault” “I had it coming” I love you so.
I love your smell, our thoughts every thing about you.
your killing me.
Why cant you just be good to me?
You say intentions don’t matter so I allow my self to think maybe I’m not doing a good enough job.
I give you all I have to give so much I don’t even know how I do it.
you say trying doesn’t count so I allow my self to think he is right I need to do a better job.
I love you and treat you like a king as I am always walking on egg shells.
You punish me and blame me for your own mistakes.
I tell people how much I care about you and how great you are as I am wearing sun glasses to cover my black eyes.
My life is falling apart and I want all this pain to end and I know  it will not unless I leave you for good.
One of the worst ways you abuse me is pretending to leave me and then act like I’m the one crawling back to you when you know you really never left me in the first place.
I threat to never see me again if I don’t do what you want but in the end you always see me the next day or two and I say I’m sorry for the mess you created and blamed on me.
I need to stop all this I need to let myself get this farce idea of you out of my head.
I look at you like a God when the truth is you are just an abuser.
