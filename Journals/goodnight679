One of my favorite foods curry!
Took over an hour to make it n I kind of failed it cause I put too much water  realized again making a good food takes lots of efforts n time.
Havenâ€™t really tried it yet cause I was eating fried chicken while I was cooking it but I will difinitly have it tmw n maybe rest of this week just eat curry.
