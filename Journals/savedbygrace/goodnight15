My grandson cursed at me and told me to leave him alone.
Then I came home and gave my husband the cold shoulder for something he said two days ago that I thought I had forgiven.
Notice the common denominator?
ME.
It reminds me of the old camp song: Not my brother, not my sister, but it’s me, Oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer;  not my preacher, not my teacher, but it’s ME, oh Lord, standing in the need of prayer.
Father in Heaven, help me to truly forgive, not just halfway.
Help me not crowd my grandkids.
“Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.”  Psalm 51 I think.
