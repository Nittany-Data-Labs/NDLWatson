I love this time of day.....twilight.
Soon I can go to bed and rest.
It’s been a wonderful day, but I am tired.
Ready for that soft pillow and warm blanket I have been so blessed with.
Yes, I do think of the homeless ones sometimes when I go to bed so safe and secure.
I pray for them.
When I had trouble with anorexia some years back, I didn’t dare think of the starving children in third world countries.
I would lose any scrap of appetite I had.
So I learned to help in whatever way I can, and then just be grateful.
I am so thankful for what I have—-a small home, a wonderful husband, a love of music, art and writing, a relationship with Jesus.
Life really is good.
If you let it be.
