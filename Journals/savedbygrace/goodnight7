Yesterday my autistic grandson left his favorite jacket on the bus, and he had a meltdown.
God bless him.
I thought he was going to run all the way down the road after the school bus.
It scared me to death.
But he only ran up the driveway and then stopped at the corner.
He was distraught.
I know how much he loves that Spiderman jacket.
I had to call his mom to talk him down.
Then he was calm again, took some deep breaths and suddenly lay down and went to sleep.
My heart is heavy today.
I don’t want it to be but it is.
When he is so frantic  and desperate, it just breaks something inside me.
I wish everything could be always right for him.
He’s a very loving boy.
God help him, please.
