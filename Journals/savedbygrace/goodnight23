I am still in a mood to talk about Light.
Maybe because it is early morning.
The birds get so happy when the first light breaks, still grey in the sky.
They sing their hearts out.
I am a sleepy-head but I love to hear them.
Doesnâ€™t make me want to jump out of bed, though.
I like to pray in the morning.
And last thing at night.
I wrote a song about it:
I will meet You in the morning
at the first light of the day.
We will walk together in Your garden,
Lord, I come to pray.
I will meet You
In the evening,
at the soft close of the day.
We will walk together in Your garden,
Lord, I come to pray.
