“Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father which is in Heaven.”—Jesus
We all have light within us.
You can share your light by just giving someone a smile.
Being happy, being creative and being kind all make your light brighter.
Have a sunshiny day, friends!
