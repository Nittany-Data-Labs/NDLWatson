My mother gave me a birthstone ring for my birthday in January.
I wear it all the time.
A garnet.
She didn’t buy it online or at Walmart, she went to the Mall to a jewelry store.
When I was growing up, my dad was absentee and sent no child support.
My grandmother raised me because Mom had to work 6 days a week and we went to church on Sundays and then she slept most of the afternoon.
But I know she loves me—-if not then, then now.
The ring represents her love.
I will always cherish it.
