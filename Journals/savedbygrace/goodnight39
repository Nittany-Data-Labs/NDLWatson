It is so cold today.
We have had to stay inside mostly just to keep warm.
But it’s been quiet and nice.
I am going to bed early (“early” even for me!)
I hope the phone doesn’t jar me awake like this morning.
Ah, well.
I am thinking of posting some of my poems.
I wonder if anyone would read them, hm?
