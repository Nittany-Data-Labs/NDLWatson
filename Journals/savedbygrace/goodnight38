Happy Valentine’s Day, Everyone!
I wish you love.
And most of all the love of God which will never let you down or fail you.
Whoever you are reading this—you are special to God.
So you can rejoice this Valentine’s day even if there was no candy or flowers in your day.
You are blessed and highly favored by God, who knows your heart.
