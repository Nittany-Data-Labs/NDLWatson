One chapter in my book talks about hearts-ease.
The word comes from a tiny flower which looks like  a miniature pansy; nowadays it is called viola.
But I love the old-fashioned name because it signifies so much.
I talk in the book about how we all need hearts-ease, rest for our souls, and peace.
And how we can learn to find it.
I hope you will buy it on Amazon or Barnes & Nobleâ€”-I know you will enjoy it.
Meanwhile, I wish you all hearts-ease, from my heart.
