The trip to the mortuary was okay.
Nobody cried or teared up.
My mom is still so basically healthy that we could feel we won’t need a casket for years.
My sister actually told her “You’re going to live to be 100.”  Afterwards we went to Wendy’s for lunch.
Thank you to anyone who prayed.
It made it so easy.
