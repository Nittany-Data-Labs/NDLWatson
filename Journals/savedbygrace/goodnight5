I hope things go better with my grandson today.
He is almost 15 and that is a difficult age to be.
I know he takes things hard sometimes.
He is also autistic and maybe bi-polar.
I love him so much.
I take care of him in the afternoons when he gets off the bus until his mom gets home.
Only God can imagine how much I love this child.
