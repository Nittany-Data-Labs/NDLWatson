I’m on my way to meet my grandsons’ bus.
Two buses.
I love this time of the afternoon when I have time with them.
We have a snack, a Bible study and then watch a movie.
He loves movies.
He is such a precious young man.
Fourteen.
He wouldn’t have to have someone meet his bus, but he loves having someone home when he gets there after a long, long day at school.
And it is my pleasure, indeed!
