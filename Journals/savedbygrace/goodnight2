I worry that some of you still have not really met Jesus one-to-one—-you and Jesus alone.
We may spend time in chapel—but have you seen with the eyes of your soul how he looks at you with love?
Do you really know the living Jesus—not from the books but from being with him in your heart?
Have you heard the loving words he speaks to you?
Ask for the grace; he is longing to give it.
