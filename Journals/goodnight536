I got my first test render for the video and it looks good so far.
It still needs a fine tuning but I will do that after I got my real footage which I will get on Thursday so everything is right on track I guess.
I had very typical day today except for that I kind of wanted to go out after work which I did not even try to.
Probably gonna watch a movie before the sleep.
anyways, good night everyone!
