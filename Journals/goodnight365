It’s been a long time that I’m writing diary here.
Well that makes me feel really lazy.
I don’t know that I have been being lazy or not.
It feels like I have a lot going on lately.
New website project that I have been working on and lots of thoughts in my head kind of drive me crazy.
However, still it just doesn’t make sense for me to skip writing diary for this long.
Now that I’m writing things down, I kind of realize how I spent my free time lately and it was very unproductive.
At some point, my goal has become blurry and I kind of forgetting where my destination is in my life.
It seems like I just kept thinking about same daily routine of my life and get bored on that instead of preparing and building things for my future.
I really need to get back on the track and get motivated again for myself and my loved ones.
I gotta stop wasting time and start doing things that benefits for my future.
I guess I start with my new project Othoo.com.
Full launch by first day of November/2014.
Get at least 10 online shops under each category and of course get all the necessary functionally done.
As I more work on this, I get the feeling that this will work if I build&maintain it right.
So yeah Let’s do this.
