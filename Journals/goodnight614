Got an message from Dustinee today about the suggestions on this site.
that made me realize that I havenâ€™t forgot about the functionally side of the site.
I spent most of time focusing on user experience and design side and still working on new theme lol.
Now that Dustinee reminded me that, I will add those things on my to do list and try to get all of those functions on the site.
She suggested adding friends button and be able to manage it,
direct messages to other users,
comment notification on the site not only with email,
and Like/Favorite button.
this will probably take some time for me to integrate all that.
However, I promise I will do my best to get that things done for people on GoodNighrJournal.com.
Since I finished watching 62 episodes of K-drama, I can finally dedicate most of my free time on this site  I want to say thank you to Dustinee for great suggestions and interest on this site.
it means a lot to me!
