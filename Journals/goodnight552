Summer is almost over...
I drove almost an hour to swim at Portage park and noticed they closed for the season.
couldn’t believe that closed already it’s still hot here.
ended up running at the park instead.
so I guess the summer is going away and I should get ready for the winter.
Today, I worked on the video thing, got my story board ready which I will go through with my friend to make sure my English is okay.
just waiting her to pick me up now.
printed out music sheet for Canon in D that I always wanted to play.
this time I won’t stop till I play it.
