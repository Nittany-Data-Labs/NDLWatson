So my apartment lease is gonna be end in a month and I have to decided in a week whether if I want to renew or not.
I’m still not quite sure what I want to do with it.
I do have a decent apartment at good location with very good price and my landlord is willing to give me a discount if I renew the lease.
However, I’m not very satisfied with my current living situation.
Not thing wrong with it.
There are just little things that bother me little bit.
Things like me spending all the money for kitchen supplies and cleaning apartment myself when my roommate were out of town for work and he coming up with excuses for not doing anything  due to the vacancy he has for work.
It was okay first and time goes by this starting to bother me little lol.
I guess I just don’t want to have extra thing that I have to take care of...
Since my roommate is my cousin, I’m more than willing to help him out as much as I can.
I think I’m gonna see if he’s gonna be good for affording apartment by himself first and make plan accordingly.
Still have a week to think about so I’m good for now.
Today I got up around 7 AM to drop off my little cousin at airport.
Back home, doing laundry and had breakfast myself.
It’s only 9:41AM now.
I’m gonna take some rest till noon and go out for skating 
The weather is amazing here in Chicago today and I’m going to take advantage of it.
Hope you do the same too!
