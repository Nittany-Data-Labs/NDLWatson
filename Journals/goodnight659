feel so much better today.
Some reason the time went by so fast at work.
Seems like things go really well today before my car broke down lol my battery died so I had to get someone to jump my car n had to change battery at pep boys.
Had dinner with my friend at buffalo joes after that.
Back home worked on site.
Added fancy editor on write a journal page but Iâ€™m not really sure that I want to keep this or not since it has some issues with load speed n couple other things.
