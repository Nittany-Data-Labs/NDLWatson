Actually, it has been like this for little bit.
My days are exactly the same.
Work, work out and home.
Nothing special or interesting.
My job pays my bills and I go out on weekends.
Also do some stuffs on weekdays.
Nothing seems wrong.
Everything is just too fine and it gets me depressed.
Nothing serious but I just hate this feeling.
Whatever I try to do, I can’t get rid of this feeling.
It always comes right back in.
Maybe the cold weather makes me feel like it?
or am I being single for too long?
I don’t know.
I just don’t like this feeling.
