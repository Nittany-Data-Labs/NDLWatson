My second entry today, since I got bored at home cause John has no Internet here  only my cellphone has access to the Internet.
It’s been snowing all day n is so nasty everywhere makes me kind of miss Cali.
It was busy day for me did bunch of things  until now.
Well, now that I don’t really have anything to do makes me think about stupid things like what’s the most important thing in my life, what am I pursuing for ... Etc etc.. Can’t even describe what I’m thinking its just so messy n complicated.
Maybe I should just keep myself really busy for a while or take another vacation to somewhere to clear my head.
