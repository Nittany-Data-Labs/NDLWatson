I got up little late, could not get a chance to have breakfast and I went to work out on my lunch break.
So I did not eat at all pretty much all day.
then my cousin wanted to have a BBQ for dinner so we did and I ate so much that I am having hard time breathing lol.
It did not end there after the dinner we went to grocery market and got pecan pie and donuts.
Although we are so full, we can still eat sugars!
how’s your Monday going?
two more days and it’s holiday!
