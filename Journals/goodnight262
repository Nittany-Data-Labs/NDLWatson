Being illegal sucks because you don’t have the fair treatments and people (most) are racist towards us (Mexican illegals).
I want to be able to travel the world but with legal documents as many do.
Besides, for the past 14 years nothing has gone well in my life and I just want to start over in my native country from zero, a new beginning.
If I finally decide to move, it will take me time to get use to my country but don’t worry, I’m making my research.
Its something that I really have to think about it before leaving the US permanently.
Here are some of my reasons why I want to leave US:

I want to be able to have a proper ID without showing my consular card, because I feel embarrass that people take a look and say (don’t really say :P) “oh she’s illegal” or  “hmmm” ( long stare if they’re able to make it eligible).
Work legally and without filling an application with fake ssn when I seek jobs.
Able to have like health insurance (ex.
medicaid, chip or any plan)
Be able to find a job that I’m comfortable with without the harassment
Able to drive with proper documentation
Able to have for once, citizen rights like many
To Travel to Europe, a long wish that I want so bad
I also want to be able to see the rest of my family before grandma passes away in the future
Be able to have a  proper life for myself and to be free of my sadness and disappointments.
For once, I want to be happy.
I’ll see what happens in a couple of months....
