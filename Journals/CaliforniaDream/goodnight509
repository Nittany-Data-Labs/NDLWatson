probably the coldest day in this winter.
I had to wear the warmest jacket that I donâ€™t like to wear.
Today, we got new video guy in the team.
Hopefully he will bring us expertise on video production that we can learn more about.
At the gym on my lunch break, I noticed that I gained about 5 lb over the weekend.
My laziness over the weekend really impacted on me a lot.
Driving over an hour to get home after work.
Already on my bed ready to go to sleep without having a dinner since I gained too much weight recently.
I get a feeling that my writing skill is getting worse.
