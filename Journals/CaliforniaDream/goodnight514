got up at 2:30 AM could not go back to sleep since then.
just been watching couple video clips from youtube and going through GoodNightJournal.
I will probably have tough time at work today by not having enough sleep but I can’t go back to sleep just craving for steak.
I’m gonna go to grocery store at 6 and buy 5 steaks for breakfast.
