46 degrees here in chicago.
It feels like yesterday when it was hot n humid.
Today, I can’t go out without a jacket.
Only thing I’m excited about this winter is the snowboarding since I couldn’t go last year.
Other than that I don’t know winter kind of lame to me.
So today, stop by at cleaner to get my clothes back, sport shop for my inline skate, and birthday dinner for my aunt n little cousin.
U all have great weekend!
