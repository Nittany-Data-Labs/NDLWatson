Yes I guess I have been very lazy for writing diary here.
I should write more often than this.
Nothing was really going on lately.
Just been little busy for meeting around people, getting things I needed.
Well nothing special.
Work is kind of quiet lately.
Could spend some time on research and inspiration which I like and good way to refresh my brain.
Went to quick shopping with John and dinner at Korean restaurant.
As always the food was awesome!
(the picture above) came back home with 2 more cycle pants lol thinking about going work with bike on this Friday.
Google map says it will take an hour and a half which should reasonable for me to try.
Iâ€™m very excited about that!
One more day!
