Things I want to get done by next week.
Video, video, and video.
I am pretty much ready just need some equipment to be delivered to my place so I can start shooing myself for footage then fine tuning animation.
that will be it and I want to get this done before end of next week.
In order to do that my tripod I purchased on online has to be arrived before Wednesday and now I have no idea when I will be getting that.
I will go to hardware store to get more light later today and extra tripod for today or tmw.
This is my third week working on this project and canâ€™t really concentrate anything else beside this.
Very beautiful day here in Chicago.
Church in the morning and swimming at the gym after.
I saw a girl at the church today who I actually saw once before and like to know more about her.
However, I get to shy to even say hi when the moment comes like today I guess.
Any advice?
I need your help on this
