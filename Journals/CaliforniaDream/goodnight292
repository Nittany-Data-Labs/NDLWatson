Had a typical Friday.
Work and awesome lower body work out on my lunch break!
We are setting up Git for our development environment for my team at work finally lol.
Had an awesome dinner with my colleagues after work at the Korean BBQ place on Lincoln Ave. 6 of us had lots of food and paid only $13 per each!
Great time!
Then I met up with Miao at the bar on buena and had more drinks  it’s 12:19 AM and I really need to go to sleep for tmw!
Had to wake up at 7 AM and get ready for the first snowboard trip to Wisconsin this year!
Excited!��
