I know I have to do something but I donâ€™t know what that is.
keep trying to move forward without having a certain destination does not give me anything.
I think I really need some time to seat down and re-build my life plans.
Last time when I actually wrote down my life plans was like 5 years ago and since then lot of things changed.
so where to start?
lol
