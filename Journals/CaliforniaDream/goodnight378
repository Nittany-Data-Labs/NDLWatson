My diary for Sunday.
It’s very nice day here in Chicago and I’m having very relax day.
Although I have been very lazy for this 4th of july weekend, I don’t really feel like doing anything today.
So I decided to just stay home and having another lazy day.
It’s 2:18 PM and I am just sitting down on my couch writing diary for today.
Went to church in the morning after two weeks of not and had ramyun lunch that I have been craving for.
I still have this little headache from 2 days ago I assume and it bothers me little.
Hopefully it goes away soon,
So today, I’m planning to do some organization on things in my life and re-arranged the plans for the future.
you know what I mean.
I have all the projects in my head and haven’t really make time to think about it.
Since everything around me gets really slow and boring, I need to boost up things for me to move forward.
