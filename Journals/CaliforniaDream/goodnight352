GoodnightJournal’s iOS App is now on Apple’s App Store for free!
It took a while to publish this app.
I know I should’ve done it long time ago lol.
Spent my last year’s holiday season to develop this app and I feel very happy to see it on the App Store.
Hope this helps more people to write journals.
Here is a link to download the app.
Just in case you can’t find it on App Store
