It’s 2 in the morning n I can’t go to sleep.
Too many thoughts = insomniac, I guess.
Well, I thought my life was goin well just like what I planned n it did till before I came here.
I was confident, I thought I could get whatever I want.
However, it didn’t take that long too realize that life isn’t always go as u planned or expected.
Lack of preparation might caused all these situations to me but beside that I didn’t have any contingency plans n now I’m just collapsing.
Well, now I learn that things don’t always go as u planned or expected n it’s always good to have contingency plans.
However, i don’t regret for what I did.
At least i got to try what I wanted to do.
Now, it’s just time for me to move on.
