So I made this site almost 2 years ago when I was in California.
Probably the toughest time in my life.
Those of you who know me probably know what I meant by that  By that time, I just needed to do something and decided to make an website for anyone who wants to write personal journal online.
Since I had been writing journals for over 8 years, it made sense to me to make website for that.
I have been running this site for almost 2 years now and met Sprout from the very beginning of the time on this site.
The amazing lady form Oregon who also has a very cute dog Sprout  Today I received a Christmas card from her that I didnâ€™t expect at all and I really needed to share this good feelings that I got from her.
It really means a lot to me.
I feel very loved and special.
I am very glad that I could meet amazing people in this site and build a good relationships with them.
Sprout always has been my biggest supporter on this site and I really appreciate all the support I got from her.
All those comforting comments on my journals and sharing all those stories and pictures with me and others on the site.
Thank you so much for the Christmas card and all your support!
I wish you a wonderful Christmas and a blessed New Year!
Charlotte, Scott and Sprout
