keep working on new theme.
got couple more pages done today.
need some more idea to make it better I think.
lately, I had to use php at work which I havenâ€™t really used for a while.
well it is really fun to use and refresh my memory but it also gives me headache little bit at the same time  the weather is very nice makes me want to go out & do something!
talked on of my best friends today made me think about the future again.
yeah, I need better plans for my future.
what I have right now is not even enough but good for starting.
the bottom line is I must constantly work on something for my future.
get more details on the plan and do things I planed.
as always my journal ended up with very messy.
lots of thoughts all over the place
