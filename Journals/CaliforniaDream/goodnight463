I feel like I have been uploading a lot of pic of food lately which means I’m getting fat?
Tonight, I went to Ethiopian restaurant with my co-workers.
I always wanted to try every time I drove by that restaurant and tonight I finally got to try it.
One of my co-worker actually knows the place so we did not even have to hassle around with ordering the food.
I don’t remember what they call but they were really good n it was interesting to eat by hand with that weird looking bread.
It is always fun to experience different cultures n foods.
That the one of the main reason that makes me want to live in the USA.
I love it.
