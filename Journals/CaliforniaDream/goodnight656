I just finished everything I planned to do today and its not midnight yet which means I can go to sleep early.
Today, I got stressed out little bit about the process I’m going through.
It’s so complicated and involves so many docs and people.
I’m getting kind of irritated for following up all that.
However, they are no shortcuts, I just have to do it.
My refrigerator has been broken 2 days so today when I got home, I ate pretty much everything I had in my fridge.
Now I’m having really hard time to digest all that lol I will probably walk around my small living room for a while before I go to sleep.
Good night everyone n don’t forget to write a journal
