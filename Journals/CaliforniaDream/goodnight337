that I need to do.
I feel like I have been very lazy for past couple months.
Just spent too much time for entertaining myself lol.
Today, I had time to go through my sites and things I need to do or I want to do.
I realized that I have things to do but don’t really know where to start.
I obviously need some time to sit down and writing down things I need to get done be priority to get the place I want to be.
I have been little just a little frustrated by not getting things that I have been trying for years which is fine cause I got used to it.
However, it sometimes becomes hard on me to accept that fact.
The bottom line is I never give up trying until I get that.
it’s 10:15pm here in Chicago.
The weather is still freezing and I’m still hoping/trying to get that thing I want  to do that I need a list of things that I need to do now to get that!
Seems like I just completed very first thing on the list now.
Goodnight everyone!
