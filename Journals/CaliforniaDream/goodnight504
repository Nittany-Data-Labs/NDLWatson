Up at 9:30 gave a ride to john, work out in the gym.
Back home went on inline skating for over an hour.
It probably was not a good idea to do that in this weather and I fell down once.
Luckly it was not that bad.
Back home around 3 cleaned up my apartment while I was doin laundry.
After that, just seating on my couch watching TV all day.
This is way too peaceful for me which got me so bored...
