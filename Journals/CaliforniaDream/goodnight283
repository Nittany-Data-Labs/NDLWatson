It’s Feb/8 here in Chicago but it’s Feb/9 in Seoul, Korea.
I just sent out an email to my dad and sister to say happy birthday.
I feel sorry for not being there for this year again.
It seems like it’s about time to go visit my family soon.
Maybe some time this year.
Although I’m thousands of miles away from them, I still love them so much and wish them a great great birthday!
