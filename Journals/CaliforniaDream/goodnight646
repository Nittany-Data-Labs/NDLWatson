feel like my life is getting boring as the time goes.
do pretty much same things everyday and nothing seems interesting.
loosing motivations and my personal goals become blurry.
Maybe I need a vacation  thinking about adding most recent public journals and pics from public journals on main page cause the main page looks too plane to me.
tried to make couple different designs but it didn’t look that good so I guess I will keep work on it till I get the design that serves better for users.
Just in case sprout22 read this, I didn’t forget about the theme I’m constantly researching and thinking to find the best solution to implement that in GoodNightJournal.com 
Anyways, we all get depressed or frustrated sometimes in our life as I am right now.
However, I believe that we all need that to get better and be more thankful when the good day comes  
For me, just writing things in my mind makes me feel so much better & relieved than just keep thinking about it.
