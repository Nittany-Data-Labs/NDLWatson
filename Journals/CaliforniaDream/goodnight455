It’s been like a week that I’m like so close to the end but can’t figure it out the one thing that is critical to the site.
Still excited about the new project that I have been working on for weeks but at the same time I get frustrated pretty much everyday for that one thing I really need.
I wish I knew more programming so I can just write my own code.
Tonight, I tried couple different ways to solve the problem but nothing worked out.
more research needed and maybe I need complete new structure.
I don’t know right now; I’m just too burned out, can’t think clearly after sitting at computer for like 14 hours lol.
