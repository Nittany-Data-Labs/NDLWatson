I have been spending over a week to get this plugin done.
It just does simple thing allow people to write/manage their posts on front-end but some reason it is so hard to make.
Everyday I felt so close to be done but today I didn’t feel like it at all.
Well still got 2 more things to finish.
However, I just can’t get this featured image working the way I want it to be working.
After number of tries.
the frustration finally hit me in the head.
I guess it’s Friday!
I will just stay away from it for the weekend.
I’m not sure if I can just forget about it but I will try to refresh and recharge myself.
Rainy Friday.
8:18 PM at home and don’t really feel like doing anything.
Except for updating othoo.com for the new cities to skate!
I made a new friend in Spain who just gave me tons of information on cities in Europe have reoccurring skating events.
So I’m gonna go update those.
Have a great Friday night and weekend everyone!
