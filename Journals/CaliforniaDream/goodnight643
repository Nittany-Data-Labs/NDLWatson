it was horrible incident over at Boston today.
I did not really follow up with what exactly happened there but I heard few people died and many people injured.
it’s just horrible n I can’t understand at all for the people who does this kind of things.
well due to my short English, I quoted the last sentence of my today’s journal entry  from (Jen Floyd Engel).
Dear God.
Comfort the victims.
And convict the rest of us to be the change we want to see in the world.
