I been doing some research about keeping a journal n it got me thinking that why do I wanna write a journal.
For me, writing a journal makes me feel peaceful.
I usually have lots of thoughts in my head.
It’s so messy n unorganized.
About 10 mins of time I get to write a journal makes me to clear my head n organize things.
It also gives  me a chance  to look back n make better plans for tomorrow.
Even though, I don’t write down everything in my head on my journal.
Hope u get something out of writing a journal.
