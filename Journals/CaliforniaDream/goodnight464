Having trouble going sleep now.
I have been trying to go to sleep for 30 mins but still fully awake.
My stomach is telling me to put some food in n my willpower trying fight against it.
I think I just have too many thoughts in my head right now like kind of fear from not knowing what is going to happen in the future?
I feel tired but still Iâ€™m not sleepy yet.
