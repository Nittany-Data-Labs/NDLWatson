It’s been over 2 months that I spent most of my free time working on this site and finally launched new design on the new server!
Big thank you to Anton who pretty much walked me through setting up new server for twice and all the amazing people in WordPress community and Stack Overflow who helped me out with bunch of programing issues.
There are still lots of things to improve but I’m so glad I just took the first step for doing all that.
I was able to build my own plugin for the main feature of site which will allow me to design the site with more flexibility.
I’m very excited for the improvement that I will make and see how people will interact with it.
It was probably the one of the best Christmas I ever had in my life.
Hope you like the new design on GoodnightJournal.com.
Merry Christmas everyone
