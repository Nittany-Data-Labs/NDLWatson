Good sleep last night.
Went to church in the morning talking to lots of people, back to home did my laundry and went through my portfolio site again.
I re-did my portfolio site last week and trying to  polish it little by little.
I have been working on this WordPress project that will help people build their own WordPress theme.
I’m putting quite amount of time on this and really wish it helps people to develop their theme.
cause I went though a hard time trying to figure out how custom theme development works which I’m still learning.
We had a snow today and it’s got cold again here in Chicago.
Trying to see how to spend rest of the day productively.
Hope you are having a great weekend.
And an update!
Double cheese burger pizza from papa johns.
I finally gotta to try it for dinner but it wasn’t good as I expected.
