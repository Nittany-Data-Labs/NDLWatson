For past couple weeks, I was not able to use my computer due to getting a new apartment stuff lol.
Now that I got my apartment ,desktop set up; I’m ready to make this website better!
After using this site for 2 months, I noticed couple things that need to be fixed and I will be working on that very shortly.
Just looking back past couple weeks, a lot of thing happened to me.
I was kind of having hard time to adapt all that situations.
I guess now it is time for me to settle down and do things that I have to do.
Well, I have so many thoughts in my head but can’t really express  all that in here at this moment with my poor English.
hopefully, writing a journal improves my writing skill.
