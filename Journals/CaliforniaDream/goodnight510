It’s been raining from the afternoon but the temperature was on mid 40s.
I had a crazy day at work.
4 different projects kicked in at the same time and tried to finish all that today.
It was just crazy I got burned out after work.
Asked my friend to go to buffet restaurant to release all the stress I got from work by eating.
Well I don’t mine being busy at work; I actually prefer to be busy.
However, I don’t feel like I am doing something that matters, I just want to do things that matters.
If you know what I mean.
