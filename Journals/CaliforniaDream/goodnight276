Because I can’t go to sleep and it’s driving me crazy!
I had a very typical day just like any other weekdays except for that I took a nap when I got home after work.
It was only few minutes and being lazy on the bed but it’s breaking my daily routine now.
I might fell asleep around 3 AM and wake up at same time.
I will go to work as tomorrow as usual and will feel sleepy and tired probably at the end of the day tomorrow.
Well I hate when it happens.
Anyways, not much going on lately.
Looking to get a ticket to Orlando for my friends birthday and playing with JavaScript.
Now I’m gonna try to go to sleep again!
Wish me luck
