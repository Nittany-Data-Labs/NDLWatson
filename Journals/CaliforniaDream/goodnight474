So these are the things I ate tonight for dinner.
I ate so much my belly is about to explode.
Although I know that I’m full, my brain keeps telling me to eat more and I’m having hard time to fight against it.
It’s happening lately that I constantly want more food.
that explains that why I was in the buffet restaurant last night lol
