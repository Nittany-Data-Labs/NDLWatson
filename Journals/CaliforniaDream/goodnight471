For 4 days of my day off, all I did was eating and eating again with no work out at all.
We had seafood hot pot(Itâ€™s vetnamese food that you cook seafood on the side of the pot in the soup on the middle of the pot while you are boiling it) yesterday which was really good then went to burger king for a dessert right after we had hot pot lol
