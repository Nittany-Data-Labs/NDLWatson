My tripod did not arrived yet started to driving me crazy cause I suppose to get it yesterday.
FEDEX misloaded my item n it delayed cause if that.
Got my new battery ordered from atnt n went to driving range with John.
I found a one in city actually really close to where I live.
The place is alright but almost twice expensive than the ones in suburbs.
Watched a movie at home and now I’m ready to sleep.
Can’t really do anything before I get my video done n my tripod is not even in the town.
Hopefully, tmw I can start working on it!
Goodnight everyone.
