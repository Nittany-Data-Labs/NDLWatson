itâ€™s Monday again yay!
Instead of wring an another journal, I just decided to add more in here since I do not really have a lot to write.
it was very typical day.
work and workout.
stopped by at Walmart for my contact lenses.
Since I opened 2 boxes, they had to talk to their boss to see if they can exchange all that to new ones or not.
So I have to call them tmw to find out.
Just got back home with a new bottle of Vitamin, had dinner for myself.
wrote journal for past week.
trying to find out the way to promote parkMartini.com.
I definitely need more traffic on this site.
