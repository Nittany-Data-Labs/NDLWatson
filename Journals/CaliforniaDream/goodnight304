I have been working on a new project for GoodnightJournal.com!
As it grows everyday, I noticed that it is crucial to have entire control of the site for main features.
Although my programming skill is not there yet, I decided to make a plugin that will allow people to write articles from front-end on WordPress.
I actually made lot of progress last week and hoping to get something this week.
All I have to do at this point is to add editing feature and test it to see it work properly.
I’m very excited about this!
so I can offer better features with much better user experience that I have been wanting to improve for very long time!
It’s sunny Sunday afternoon!
Came to Everybody’s coffee to get some of my things done.
Just finished writing journals and will go through my sites for regular maintenance.
Also have to update Trello for list of things I want to get done this week!
1:32 PM here in Chicago, I want to get this done soon and spend sometime for skating before Miao’s for the walking dead tonight.
Hope all of you have a great Sunday
