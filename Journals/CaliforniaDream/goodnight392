Having very peaceful Saturday so far.
Cleaning up my apartment, paying all the bills, doing laundry and went to gym for swimming.
Donâ€™t really have anything for rest of the day so I think I will just enjoy watching world cup and relax.
We had World cup theme Road Rave last night and it was fun as usual.
Some reason tho everyone got really tired after the skating.
We were assuming if was the very moisturized weather but no one really knows.
Well the bottom line is we all have fun.
