Still no motivation... Don’t really feel like doing something but eating.
yeah whatever happens to me, I always make sure that I put something in my stomach.
Weather has been cold for all week and it will be cold rest of the week.
Work was alright got just enough project to spend a day.
Wanted to go eat something after work with someone but kind of missed timing.
She called me too late after I ate myself already.
so that’s that and just writing a journal to warp up my day at 9PM.
What should I do now?
