working on responsive layout for the site.
fixed log-in input fields and top navigation that covered top part of the contents.
if you have a screen resolution lower than 744 px width, you will see mobile version layout.
I’m still working on this issue n will have better layout for mobile device, tablets, and computers.
Good thing that I actually work on WP theme at work which makes my job easier to work on this site after work cause I learn something new pretty much everyday about WP and I could just use it right away in this site.
I’m also thinking about getting new design for the site.
