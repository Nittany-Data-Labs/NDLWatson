like this weeks prayer of confession.
Sounds like something I would pray these days.
I’m sharing this here.
In our times of joy and our times of sorrow God is always present with us.
Let us turn now, together, to ask God to be with us even when we are at our most vulnerable.
Let us pray:
Ever present God, sometimes life doesn’t look like we want it to look.
We think if only we try harder, or pray more, or smile all day, or say just the right thing or look just the right way life will all come together and make sense.
But, it doesn’t.
Or it does.
Either way, it’s lonely.
Remind us that you are in this with us.
Broaden our ideas about healing so we can find you in the midst of our struggle.
Forgive our self-reliance.
Help us to see you.
Amen.
