probably the first peaceful weekend for me ever since I moved back to Chicago.
even last weekend, I had to run around to get furniture and stuff all day.
Today, I didn’t have to although my apartment obviously needs more furnitures  and some home goods, it’s good enough to live myself for now.
I had a long sleep till 11am, went out for lunch at Windy city whatever restaurant.
Took a nap for little bit and had dinner at friend’s place.
Played really fun card game with friends kind of getting obsessed with that game lol.
Almost 11pm now, all I want to do is have some good rest for myself just be super relaxed.
