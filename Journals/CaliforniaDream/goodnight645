spent peaceful time myself in the morning till 4 PM when I woke up from the nap.
bought a TV at best buy and went to spa place with my friends.
well that spa place is actually pretty cool than I expected.
it’s got a restaurant inside and several different sauna room with different themes.
we spent about 3 hours there experiencing all that.
got home around midnight and I’m sleepy again.
hope all of u had a great Saturday!
