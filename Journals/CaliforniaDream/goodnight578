Godaddy put me on the old server till now cause I signed up like 5 years ago.
So they just kept me on the server that I had when I signed up which made my sites very unstable.
Now I requested to move everything to new server n hopefully it will solve the load speed issue.
Canâ€™t believe they just left me on the old server cause I have been a customer for long time?!?!
Please let me know if anyone have problem with load speed on the site.
