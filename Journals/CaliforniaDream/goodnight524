My snowboard is back again after 2 years of missing a binding.
I was not able to go snowboardning at all last year due to moving to Cali and trying to get a new jobs in new industry etc... now that I think about that time went by really fast it’s been almost an year already ever since I moved back to Chicago.
Anyways, I just can’t wait to go use it!
