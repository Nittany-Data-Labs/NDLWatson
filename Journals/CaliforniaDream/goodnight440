I’m struggling on my project.
It’s taking longer than I expected and I still have no solution on the problem.
I went to the WP meeting last night with hope that I find someone who can help me with programming.
I talked most of people there got one guy who might be able to help me out with the issue.
I was trying to define problem to him then I realized that not even myself know exactly what is the problem that holding me down.
So I failed to explain that to me but got his card has email address on it.
From last night, I tried to find the problem that I can ask him to advice but It’s still not clear to me.
I’m just struggling now.
Maybe I need to get away from this for little bit to get refreshed.
Well tonight, I just gonna watch Jimmy Kimmel Live.
