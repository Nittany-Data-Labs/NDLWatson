I am writing a journal even though I got nothing to write about.
have lots of thoughts in my head kind of drives me crazy but still don’t know what to write.
It’s probably the last Saturday in Cali and I will be leaving on next Saturday.
For that 7 months, I have learned and experienced many things.
Probably the toughest time in my life and it changed me, made me think differently.
I’m not sure what I am exactly talking about just writing something that pops up in my had.
yeah everything will be fine.
