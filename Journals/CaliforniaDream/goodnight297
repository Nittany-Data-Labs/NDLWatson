This wonâ€™t be the last game for Cubs in 2015!
They are playing now at Wrigley field and now Iâ€™m watching Bulls game with a glass of gin & tonic cause I donâ€™t have subscription for the Cubs game.
Plus, too lazy to go to the bar like 3 mins away ðŸ˜‰ However, if they win today and get to the world series, I will gracefully walk to the Wrigleyville to watch the game and enjoy the crowd!
Still working on my Write Here plug in!
got a lot done today tho.
Now, I have to get the setting page in admin panel.
Hopefully, I get it done tomorrow or day after tomorrow.
8:50 PM now.
I donâ€™t think I will do anything tonight.
Just be relax at home.
