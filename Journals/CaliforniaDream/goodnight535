My favorite tea that I only drink when it gets cold.
I had my first earl grey in this season yesterday n having another one now.
I will go crazy for this as the weather gets more cold.
I was expecting to shoot a video today but tripod did not arrived yet... work was okay just designing a website all day.
Stopped by at at&t store for the battery on my new phone and talked spout about the editing a comment function.
Added into to do list!
So this is the day I had today.
Howâ€™s yours?
