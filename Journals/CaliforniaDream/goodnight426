Today, I woke up at 7 in the morning and got church at 8 am to help Eddi moving from South West suburb to North side of Chicago.
I always like helping people out so I decided to spend my Saturday helping him moving.
there were 3 other people came to help.
We drove an hour to get there load everything to truck and unload everything back at the high rise apartment in Lakeview.
Long story short it was fun to meet new people and feels good to be able to helping someone out but I just got too tired lol.
Finished everything got back home right before 5pm.
All I want right now is just stay  at home maybe watch some tv and have a long sleep lol I probably have to move too end of April and I donâ€™t really know if I want to do it or not.
