My Tuesday is almost over.
The day with.
Full of expectation.
More like waiting for a miracle lol well I expect that everyday.
The truth is nothing really happened but I can’t just give up!
I will keep try and keep expecting.
Now I’m going sleep with a hope that tomorrow it will happen!
Till my dreams come true!
Goodnight everyone.
