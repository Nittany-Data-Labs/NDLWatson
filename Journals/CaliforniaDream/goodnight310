Tuesday but it feels like Thursday.
I haven’t really done anything this week Monday and today.
Just work and home.
I did nothing yesterday after work.
Just rolling around on my bed for little bit, later dinner and TV then had a trouble going sleep... Fortunately, I didn’t really feel tired at all today at work cause I was fully focused on the project all day.
I decided to build a plug-in for myself for this site since the one I paid is not really working out.
I don’t know if I’m gonna be able to get it done or not but I will try.
It makes more sense more me to have control for the main functionally of the site.
I can also make it more flexible that way since I want to make this more user friendly.
11:22 PM now in Chicago.
The weather is getting chilly everyday.
Winter is really coming.
Hopefully, this winter will be different.
Just expecting something new I guess
