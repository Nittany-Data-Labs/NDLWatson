the places I have to go at least one in my life.
found this place randomly on online and just fell in love with it.
It must be feel so good to swim there and I really want to do it.
I will definitely be there swimming someday.
I been pretty busy with my cousin Luke to take him around city for past 4 days.
he left to San Francisco today morning and now I am back to my normal life again.
I had very typical day today.
just one thing kind of bothers me all day that I don’t know when godday is going to move my server to new server.
I want to make sure everything works okay after moving to new server but I can’t just stand by forever.
lol kind of drives me crazy.
