It’s been couple weeks to have password reset issue on this site and I finally got to fix it!
I’m so glad the plugin author came out with new version that will work with latest WP.
I will have to see if I get any more complains about this but it seems fine for now.
I had to do lots of extra work to make it work and display as way it should be lol.
Spend about 2 and a half hour straight on this thing.
Now I have to get back to othoo.com.
I also have to send email to Ben about the site.
Hopefully it will work out well.
Gotta go for  now.
It’s 9:28PM already and I don’t have enough time to do all of those things!
