Sunday night diary, probably the best time to write a diary cause I usually spend some time on Sunday night to look back past week and planing the next week.
So looking back last week, I was just struggling on my new project all week.
nothing was really going on beside that cause I spend all my free time on that.
For next week, I want to launch the site.
I gave up the function I want and decided to change the direction little bit.
However if it goes well, I will get definitely that function in the site.
Well that’s that, I did a lot today.
church in the morning, laundry, cleaning up my apartment, went to shopping with my cousin and had dinner with more cousins.
I treated them today cause I got raised last week.
that my boss promised last year.
back home around 9PM, sitting at my computer trying to setup parkMartini again.
That’s all I did today.
How was yours?
how do u usually spend Sunday night?
?
