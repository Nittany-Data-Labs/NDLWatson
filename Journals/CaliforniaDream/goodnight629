I have been very lazy to keep up with my online journal.
Got back to working on new design last week but have not touched it till now.
maybe I will get back to it tmw.
wanted to go to buffalo wild wings so bad but could not find someone to go with.
everyone I know are so busy for doing something or studying for final and stuffs.
sometime it is very hard for me to find someone to have dinner with and it gets irritating sometimes.
tonight I am going to sleep early still tired from last night.
It was so fun tho.
went out with my friend had lots of beer and met lots of nice people in my neighborhood.
