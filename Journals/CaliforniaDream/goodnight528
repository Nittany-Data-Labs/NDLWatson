I know you can’t really tell from the picture but it was actually snowing quit a lot today in Chicago.I guess it’s about time to see snowing but I wasn’t ready for it at all.
I need to get a snow brush and shovel ASAP.
However, it kind of feel good to watch snowing.
Work and work out on lunch break.
had dinner with my friends at my place.
the weather is getting cold and cold.
I guess that’s pretty much it for today, I have to make a call to my grand mom to say happy birthday.
Goodnight everyone!
