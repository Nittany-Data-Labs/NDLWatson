felt little weird for getting rejected cause I’m not used to it cause I don’t usually try that much.
I was kind of hoping maybe she is the one for me but it does not seem like it anymore.
It is funny that I write a journal with this issue that I usually don’t.
I guess at the end I’m just a normal person.
I want to see why she said she can’t but I don’t know it’s worth it.
Just writing things down to make my feel better.
It’s been a very long week and lots to think about.
