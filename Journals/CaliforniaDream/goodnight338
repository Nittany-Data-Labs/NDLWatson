It’s been freezing the whole week but today is the worst.
All public schools are closed today due to the weather condition but I had to go to work  Well, work wasn’t that bad just so busy I got burned out at the end lol.
Got right back to home and took a hot shower which made me feel so much better.
Fixed update issue on the site and trying to see what to do for rest of the night.
I have bunch of things that I want to do but not sure what to do first and how to do it right.
I probably need some time to organize my thoughts.
Have goodnight and stay warm everyone!
