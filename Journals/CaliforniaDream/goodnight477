I took a day off today for the dentist but it got messed up now.
My insurance company has this stupid waiting period thing that I can only get benefits after an year of sign up day which will be Sep/1/14.
So I have to go talk to HR tmw to find out what I can do.
Also had a car wash for thr first time since I got a new car.
After the car wash I realized that I need to take care of my car almost 6 momths of abandonment really messed up my car paint.
Stopped by downtown for quick shipping and will go ice skating in Lincoln park zoo(pic above) in a min.
So we got one more day left for 2013.
How should I spend the last day productively or memorably?
