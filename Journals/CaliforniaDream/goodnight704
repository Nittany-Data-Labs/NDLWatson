I’ve been sick.
Today, I just went out for lunch appointment n boxes for packing stuffs.
When I got back home, I just wanted to go to sleep which I did but failed.
Cold medicine didn’t make me go to sleep.
Feel better than yesterday.
Feel like I’m gonna be fine tmw if I sleep good tonight which probably not gonna happen.
