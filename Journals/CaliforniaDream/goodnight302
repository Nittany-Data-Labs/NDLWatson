Arrived at Tampa around 7 PM!
JungA picked me up at the airport and drove to the house.
I had huge dinner with Korean food and some talk with her and her family.
BTW, I’m here for her graduation TMW.
After the dinner, I spent time on GoodnightJournal.com.
I kind of got too excited to stop working on it.
I even worked on it in the airplane lol and I actually got a lot done.
Now, it the new plugin keeps creating the problems.
Something is very wrong on this plugin lol.
Definitely need more time to get it right.
11:55 PM here in Tampa.
I feel pretty tired now since I woke up way to early today.
Was it around 4 AM?
lol I’m going to wrap things up here and go to sleep.
Kind of feel little uncomfortable here.
