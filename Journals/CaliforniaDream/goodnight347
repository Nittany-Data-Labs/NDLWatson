Had hard time sleeping last night.
Got up couple times cause my nose n throat got dried up while I was sleeping.
It’s been happening for couple days and today I finally feel sick not as much as last time when I couldn’t go to work but annoying enough for me to do my daily stuffs.
Tried to go to sleep around 9:30pm but couldn’t fell asleep so I’m writing journal now on my new iPhone.
Debated for a day if I wanna get new phone or not.
Ended up getting new iPhone 6 I actually wanted to get.
So my bills gonna be up but now I’m enjoying my new phone:) it’s been snowing all day and it will get colder this week.
Well I just want to get better and doing things I planned for my future.
2015 will be great for me!
Stay warm everyone!
