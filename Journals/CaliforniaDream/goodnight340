I just submitted GoodnightJournal iOS app to Apple’s App Store and had to pay $100 per year to do that(too expensive I think compare to Google Play Store).
I’m not sure how long it will take that to be approved and be available in App Store.
However, I feel very accomplished now.
Spent all night working on the app and spent pretty much all week to figure out how to make it work.
Well had to go through bunch of tutorial videos to make it happen.
I wanna give you a hand up that the first version is not gonna be perfect but I will try to improve it continuously.
So more people can enjoy writing journals.
Feel pretty exhausted now.
Still feel little sick and the cold medicine I took 30 mins ago finally kicks in.
I’m going sleep now... Goodnight everyone!
