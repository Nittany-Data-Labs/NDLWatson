March/18/2015 11PM in CST, I updated new design on GoodnightJournal.com.
I wanted to make it more simple and easy to write/read journals.
I choose one column layout and removed all unnecessary stuffs out of the way.
So people can focus on writing and reading journals better.
Hope it helps for the users who write journals here.
FYI, this is the beginning of the making this site better.
There will be more small updates to make things work smoothly.
Please feel free to leave any comments or feedback on the comment section.
I would love to hear your thoughts and I will listen!
