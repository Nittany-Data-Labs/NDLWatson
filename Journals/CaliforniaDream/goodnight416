Such a beautiful day here in Chicago.
It actually went up to 70 degrees finally and I had to take advantage of it!
So I got out to lake as soon as I got home and skated to downtown.
I got a feeling that it will become my daily routine.
Felt so good to skate aground in thia amazing weather.
I had to stop on the way back cause my friend wanted to have a dinner with me and he actually came to pick me up on my way back to home.
So we went to the African restaurant that I always wanted to try.
Well it wasn’t that good than I expected but the rice was really good.
Also foind out they are Nigerian restaurant.
We came back to my place had a bottle of beer.
He left little bit after and I finnal get to take a shower.
Feel really good right now fully ready to go to sleep.
I’m plannig to have really good sleep tonight!
Hope u do too.
Goodnight.
