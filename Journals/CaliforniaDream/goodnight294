I found myself getting very irritated for this situation especially after driving almost an hour to get back to home and it’s hard to find street parking around here.
This does not happen often but when it happens... I just hate it.
Maybe I should just call the towing company but feel sorry to do that.
Well, I just don’t want to deal with this 
7:56 PM on my living room now don’t have any plans for rest of the night.
Just couple things to take care of for my websites.
2 more days to go this week!
Seems like I’m gonna get two guests tomorrow at my place.
David just messaged me and asked to stay a night at my place on his way to Vancouver.
