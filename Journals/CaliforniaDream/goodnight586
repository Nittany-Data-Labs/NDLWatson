I should have had this long time ago.
my apologies who had problem with uploading images on journal entries.
It didnâ€™t allow you to upload image files bigger than 2MB before Now you can upload any size of image file on your diary!
GoodNightJournal will re-size your image to proper size for web.
Use latest smart phone has 8 mega pixel camera or something like that?
Now you can upload your pictures directly to GoodNightJournal.com from your phone.
so hope you enjoy!
