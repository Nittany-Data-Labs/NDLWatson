First time doin BBQ at the beach in this year.
Since Im the one who live close to the beach, I had to prepare lots of things.
People came over around 3 n went out to beach.
Had lots of food n really fun time.
The weather was amazing too!
Back to home around 8:30 checked out some other sites include this one n now Iâ€™m ready to watch a movie before the bed.
Hope you all having a great weekend!
