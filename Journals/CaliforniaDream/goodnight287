My diary for January/02/2016
The second day of 2016.
It was freezing below 32 degree weather but the sun was out all day.
I had to go out with my skate on since the sun is out.
However, low temperature made it harder to skate plus the wind.
I skated for 9.9 miles along the lake.
Although it was freezing and my skating muscles are hibernating, it was a lot of fun.
I don’t know if I can live without this.
I finally had a good and long sleep today.
I woke up after 1 PM and went out for skating.
Back home around 3:30 then headed out to Everybody’s coffee again with my laptop.
I stopped by here to grab Chai latte when I got out for skating.
I have been here for over 3 hours now and got a lot done.
My plugin update, entering skating events to othoo.com, got dates for Chicago skating and updating content on GoodnightJournal.com.
I still need to do backup on this site and I’m not sure if I’m gonna feel like doing it tonight when I get home but this has to be done soon.
6:34 PM and it’s dark outside already.
No plans for rest of the day.
I will probably take off soon to home and grab something for dinner on the way.
