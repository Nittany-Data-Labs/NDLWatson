Summer time but the weather dose not seem to get any warmer at all here  Today, I had a long rest all day and finally got better from the flu.
no more runny nose or cough.
Still have little bit of headache though.
kind of feel like wasted all week by being sick.
now itâ€™s time to get back to work again n try not to miss my diary.
