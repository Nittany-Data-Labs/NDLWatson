Up around 9 AM.
Starting with laundry and clearning my apartment.
Got my first maintenance service on my car after that stopped by at walmart to get the new contact lenses sample which I like much better already.
I will exchange all the lenses I bought to this new brand I got today.
Back back home around 4:30 taking a rest now till 5:45 when I have to go to cosbyâ€™s kitchen for taes birthday party.
