Another week has began.
I felt like going work after the long vacation cause of the short snowboard trip.
Maybe I need a real vacation so I don’t feel like that for the one day trip to Wisconsin.
It was snowing in the morning but went away in couple hours and the weather was still freaking cold.
I still feel little tired and I don’t think I was on a condition that I usually have on normal days.
just need one more day to recover.
Drive right back to home after work.
traffic was beautiful hope it’s like today everyday.
had small dinner myself, shower then wrote journals for a week.
It’s 8:50pm on my bed with my laptop.
probably going sleep early tonight.
goodnight!
