To write a journal here.
I have been busy lately.
Since the weather got nice, I use most of my free time skating around city that I couldn’t do over the winter time.
I skated too much my feet and legs are sore for about two weeks lol.
It was raining all day today in Chicago and I finally got some time to sit down going through my stuffs on my computer.
Things look pretty good.
Just one thing that I always want to get is still in progress  I realize more lately that I have to be more smarter on this.
Things that I have been doing are obviously don’t work out pretty good.
I need to figure out the smarter way to do things.
Well we will see how it goes 
11:17 PM on my bed.
listening music and writing a journal for today.
I live everyday trying and dreaming to get things I want in my life and I will never give up till I get that.
It’s just my life at least for now.
