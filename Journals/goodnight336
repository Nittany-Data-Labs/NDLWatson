Just want to let you know that comment function is back.
I was updating the site for past couple days and some how it got removed from the site.
I noticed today and got it back at the place where it was.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Commenting on someone’s public journal is a great way to interact with others on this site.
I strongly recommend you to do it if you haven’t done it yet 
Goodnight everyone!
