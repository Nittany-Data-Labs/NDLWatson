who helps me out for the things I need especially things like this website in this case  I would not be able to do this without them.
Also love spending time with them to do fun things in the great city Chicago.
Hopefully next year will be the same or better 
It’s the day after Christmas and it’s been raining all day here in Chicago.
Could not go out skating because of that but went to gym for swimming instead.
It was lots of fun to swim for an hour after not doing it for a while.
Well, swimming is good but I still feel like I need to find some other activities to do for days like this.
