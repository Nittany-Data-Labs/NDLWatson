people saying the summer is over here in Chicago.
However, I still see the nice weather everyday  my cousin is visiting me from Tampa and will go back to Korea after the trip.
I have been spending time with him pretty much all day.
tried to take him to as many as attractions in Chicago.
Today, I had little time to organize things and now time to play agian!
