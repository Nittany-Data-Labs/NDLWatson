Idk why but they r having fireworks at navy pier.
Maybe cause of the Blackhawks?
No clue lol just working around the lake saw the fireworks goin decided sit down n write a journal for tonight.
Have some unnessacery thoughts in my head, want to clean it up n get back to the way I should be.
I guess I just took a first step by setting up localhost.
Watching firework kind of makes me depressed little bit I gotta leave lol
