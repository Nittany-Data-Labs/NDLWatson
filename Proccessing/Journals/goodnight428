It’s snowing here in Chicago.
It was like 80 degrees couole daya ago and now it’s snowing.
What a amazing weather.
I got a lot to do tonight.
More revision for book cover, reply email to ebay, and estimate for the new project and dinner with my friend.
I dont know how am I going to do all that but I have to make it.
