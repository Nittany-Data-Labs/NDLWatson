It’s been a while to write a journal here.
yes I have been very lazy and kind of busy.
Lots of holiday things and some other things.
Couldn’t really have time to look through all my projects and this site.
I know that I have to get back to it but just can’t get the time for this.
Maybe I’m not motivated enough now.
Well, I found this guy’s portfolio site today which actually got me motivated little bit.
His portfolio is so beautiful makes mind looks like a junk.
Now I see why I haven’t got a luck on all my attemptings.
Yes it’s time to get back to work!
Get motivated!!!
It has been raining all day.
Work was okay felt little slow all day.
Started work out for the triathlon training.
I biked for 7 miles and run/walk for 3 miles.
Realized that I’m so out of shape for such a intense cardio like that.
I have to work out regularly now on.
Not much going on.
Just typical stuffs with endless hope of something better...
Goodnight!
