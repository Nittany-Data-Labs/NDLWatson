Still cold little bit but its definitely getting Warmer.
The weather is so nice today made me get out of my apartment walk around.
Since, I had to go to bank, I decided to walk there n it was really nice.
I could feel spring by my whole body.
Yup the summer is coming n Chicago is becoming more beautiful n attractive.
