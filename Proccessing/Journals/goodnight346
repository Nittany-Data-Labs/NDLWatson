It’s been snowing from last night here in Chicago n it will go on all day today!
Can’t believe I made to church in the morning.
Feel accomplished lol not much going on today.
Just a super bowl party at my friends place later today.
Since it’s nasty outside, I will probably walk to the place.
Trying to write journals for a week on my bed.
I’m leaving to Miami this Friday n am very excite about that  can’t wait to get away from the cold for a moment and enjoy skating!
I set up tumblr page last night.
Trying to see how it works and to post somethings I like to share.
Lots of good things I like to adapt on goodnightjournal.com.
I’m thinking about making a prototype for the front-end form to be more user friendly.
Then see how am I going to actually make it work.
That’s about it.
Have a great super bowl Sunday n stay warm everyone
