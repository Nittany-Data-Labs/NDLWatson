God 
it’s true;
I love You.
But does it show?
God, does your light shine through?
Do any but my closest friends know?
Daily I promise You my heart, then go
scattering my hours in idleness, dear God.
I dream of Heaven, but seek things below;
earthly treasures that shine and glow.
I need to be with You
so that you’ll know
I love you.
I do,
God.

The diatelle is a strict poem style based on both syllables and rhyme but not meter.
I tried to type out the form but hit a wrong key and erased it.
Blah.
When typed centered on a page it forms a diamond shape.
Fun.
