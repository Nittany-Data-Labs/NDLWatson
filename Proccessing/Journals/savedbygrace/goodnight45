The path seems barren,
dreams but dust.
Yet watch and trust;
He walks with you
and ever will.
Heart, be still.

Okay, confession:  that is only half the poem.
I got tired of having to readjust the font to 18 for every single line.
Hope somebody enjoys reading this anyhow.
Itâ€™s part of The Beautiful Truth.
Blessings to all!
