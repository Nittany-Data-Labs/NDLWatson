I am writing this blog to encourage others who are down and suffering.
Dare to hope.
I’ve been where you are.
The black hole.
It doesn’t have to last a lifetime.
There is healing to be had.
Seek Jesus, the great Healer.
If anyone would like prayer, I will be glad to add you to my list of prayers for bloggers.
May God give you peace.
