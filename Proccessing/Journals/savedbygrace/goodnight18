I am so delighted!
I just found out a friend of mine bought six  copies of my book THE BEAUTIFUL TRUTH by Lynn Roberson at Amazon.com to give to friends!
Wow!
I am so happy!
The message of the book is healing because it is about finding peace through the unconditional love of Jesus Christ.
It is not preachy at all.
It’s little stories and anecdotes about how God has intervened in my life to bring me back to Him when I was trying to wander.
It’s funny and heartwarming.
I hope a lot of people will buy it and read it.
Read it is the important part—borrow a copy if you can.
