I am blessed with a loving, close family.
My daughter teaches special needs Middle school and has her Master’s degree and is raising her two special needs boys.
I think the boys have brought us all closer together.
It is true that they are a gift from God.
My mother is 92 and still capable in every way.
We have dinner at her home every Friday.
We work hard to keep the family close.
My sister is a music teacher with a master’s in piano performance.
Wow—-you should hear her play the piano!
I am so proud of her.
I play the piano some; my hands are smaller and octaves put a strain on those little muscles in the fingers.
But I enjoy playing.
My brother-in-law is a wonderful person, a retired minister.
My husband is the dearest man in all the world.
And we have a golden retriever who is a sweetheart.
All sound too good to be true?
Well, I’m just telling you the highlights.
We have cloudy days, too, sometimes.
More in the past.
I want to help you think about the highlights in your life, too!
