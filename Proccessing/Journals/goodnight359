GoodNightJournal.com has gotten over 50,000 registered members by today(OCT/13/2014).
I’m very happy to see that a lot people actually writing journals online and very glad that GoodNightJournal can be part of that.
I couldn’t even imagine this will come this fast when I launch the site on Jan/1/2013.
I’m hoping to see more and more people keep their personal journals.
It doesn’t have to be here.
Just a piece of paper and a pen would work perfectly fine or there are many websites or applications out there you can use for keeping your journals.
However, you are more than welcome to use this site and I will keep it open for this free for everyone.
Just want to say that I’m very happy to see all this and want you to know that writing journal is awesome!
and you should try if you haven’t done it yet!
