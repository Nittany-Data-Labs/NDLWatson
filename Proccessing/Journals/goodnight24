A friend just told me she is going to start journaling to Jesus.
I am so delighted because I have experienced such a closeness to Him from doing just that.
I have literally a foot-locker full of journals that are prayers and conversations with my Lord.
It brought me so near to Him.
I hope others will try this too.
God bless you.
