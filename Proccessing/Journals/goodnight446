I was feeling really good all day from a deep sleep last night till when I got off the work.
I asked my friends to go out to have couple beer tonight then when I got off the headache kicked in all the sudden.
Got home about an hour ago n taking a rest till my friend gets here.
Don’t really want to cancel it since I made them come out lol.
Nohing really going on lately just working and being lazy.
Had really good dinner last night at korean restaurant called crisp.
Definitely gonna go eat again.
Sharing pic as well.
Been thinking about something kind of a lot and found that it kind of bothers me.
So I decided not to think about it.
8:50 pm just waiting for my friend.
Hope it’s friday night.
