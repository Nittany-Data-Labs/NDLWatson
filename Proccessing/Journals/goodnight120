From high above the water crashes down
Dampened skin, hearts pounding heavy
In the dark cave, behind the water fall
Your arms wrapped my frame
It’s time say good bye
This is the only way
One soul has been claimed
And I choose it to be you
The moment is at hand
In the dark Ba swings his sword
You never saw it coming
I kiss at gash as the blood runs down
You were my ultimate sacrifice 
I stare into your eyes
In that moment as you take your last breath
You have a revelation as the light shines bright, calling you home
Love and Hate is the same
In the eyes of Inanna
 
For centuries I have paid the price for your death
Always missing you, always longing
Never able to trust again
I hear your call in the wind
I taste your kisses in the rain
I can’t find you my love
I’m paying the price
In this immortality, I am reborn
Only to be haunted by the ghost of you
