Feel so much better yesterday but still don’t feel okay.
Last time I got sick like this was like 6 years ago when I passed out all day for like almost a week.
Today, I was able to make it to work.
I almost call off but feel so irresponsible to do it two days in a row plus I felt good enough to walk around.
It’s lunch break and I skipped the gym.
Instead had a soup and writing a journal after long time of not lol
