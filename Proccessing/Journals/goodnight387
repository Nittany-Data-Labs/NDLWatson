Lately, I always feel like I got bunch of things to get done and did not really know what to do or where to start.
I kind of feel like that it’s programed in my brain that I’m busy that I got things to do.
Well yes I do and I do all the things that needs to be done but I don’t have to be push my self and stressed down about that.
I guess I need to learn the way to enjoy my life and do things that needs to be done.
It’s always been my problem that when one thing gets in my head, I can get rid of it till I solve that issue or remove the problem.
I need to give myself a room to breath and be calm.
Today, I spent most of my free time working on the freelance project that I have been thinking of all day.
It feels really good to get things done but just hated the time that I was worrying about it all day.
I always wanna move forward, make myself better and get things that I want.
For doing that, I think I push myself way too much in a very not productive way.
As I always say, I need to sit down and take a time to think back and organize stuffs.
It does not seem like a lot going on rest of the week.
Hopefully, I will have the time for that.
Just wrote my messy thoughts and yes it is messy...
