    So I run an in-home daycare.
I actually went to school to be a preschool teacher but then found out I make much better money running a daycare from my home especially because then I don’t have to pay for my kids daycare this way while I am working.
I will never get rich of off an in-home daycare but I am okay with that.
We have more than enough and I am happy.
Its funny with my tattoos and abstract writing and other things about me I don’t think a lot of people would expect me to be one to work with kids.
But I do and I love it.
Honestly I don’t think I would love anything else as much as I do teaching and working with children.
Teaching preschoolers has always been my what I wanted to do when I grew up.
I am lucky to be one of the few people that can say I am what I wanted to be when I grew up.
I am good at what I do so its pretty easy to get customers for me.
I put together unique lesson plans.
We do not watch tv at all which is a great selling point for child care.
Every day we do art, music, reading and math or science.
I provide much healthier food then most daycares and I truly love being able to have just enough kids to be able to do group projects and games but also spend one on one time with each one.
To a point I also get to set my own hours and I love that lol who wouldn’t?!
SO ....
Todsay I have TWO new kids coming!!!!!!!
I am so excited!
I am wearing my favorite red long flowered dress to make a good impression and have plans to take them to the park across the street if it is nice enough.
