     What is wrong with me that I keep putting my self through this?
I keep telling my self I am leaving and not going back.
I always go back.
Yet again I have another bruise.
This time was even more scary.
I couldn’t even stand to look at him whit his hands around my neck.
What if he didn’t let go when he did?
Does he have it in me to kill me?
At one time I would have thought of course not, Now I am not so sure anymore.
I just feel so stupid I cry and I cry and scream begging him to stop.
I just want it all to stop.
I feel so stupid.
What the hell is wrong with me?
I am a smart woman.
I know the abuse will not stop.
It will only get worse.
How much worse can it get before I am back in the ER with a broken bone lying to a doctor about falling down the steps or even worse dead.
