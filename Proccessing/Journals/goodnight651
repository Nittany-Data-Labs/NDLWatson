Ever since I got new tires on the front, my steering wheel has been shaking while I was driving.
So to day I decided to stop by at pepboys n fix the problem since I skipped the gym after work due to insanity cold weather.
Can’t belive it’s first day of spring.
Met Kevin at the autoshop he had been waiting 2hours even before I got there n he left at the same time as me after another 2 hours n half lol I had dinner at noodle company while I was waiting with heather also did grocery shopping back home around 9:30 n exhausted.
Didn’t even turn on my computer at home just wanna take a rest n sleep.
