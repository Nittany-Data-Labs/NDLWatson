You probably noticed already if u r reading this that public journal page is loading very slow.
This is because I’m working on this page.
There was a change in public journal page that it only shows one latest journal entry from each author in the site.
This will prevent seeing bunch of journal entries from one author.
I’m still working on this page to load faster and it is taking longer than I expected.
I’m trying to get this done within this weekend.
Please be patience till then.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
