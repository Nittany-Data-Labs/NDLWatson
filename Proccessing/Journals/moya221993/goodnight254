“Write me, when the wind undresses the trees..everyone else has gone to the movies now...but you want to be alone and you don’t feel like talking, now write me... It’s gonna be useful to make you feel less fragile...when in the people you’ll find, just indifference...
I want you to never forget me...(2x)
If you don’t find special words to tell me, please don’t worry I can understand...for me, it’s enough to know that you are thinking about me even for a minute because I’ll be satisfied if you send a greeting...its enough a little to feel closer..(2x)
Write me, when the clear sky shines again and the days will be longer but you don’t wait at night...
If you want to sing, write me...even when you believe that you have fallen in love... (2x)
Just write me”
–Nino Buonocore (original), Laura Pausini (Cover)
