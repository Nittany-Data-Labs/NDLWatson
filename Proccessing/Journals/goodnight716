6th Christmas that Iâ€™m spending here in the state without my family  this year is little different cause its not cold at all compare to the other 5 Christmas or ones before.
Feel kind of weird.
Today, I served at the homeless shutter that I try to go every Friday for volunteering.
After that I came down to la; had dinner with my friend n having a hot coffee now.
Feels good
