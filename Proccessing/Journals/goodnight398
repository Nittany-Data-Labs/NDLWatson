I feel like I got really lazy lately for writing journals.
I had somethings to take care of like moving and stuffs.
However even after the moving, I didn’t really keep up with journals as before and I want to change that.
I know writing journal everyday here might be almost impossible but I will try hard to write as many as journals possible for myself.
We had a chilly day today.
I kind of feel like the weather is getting colder and colder.
Despite the  chilly temperature and strong wind, I decided to go out skate when I got home from work cause I know  it will make me feel good and it did.
Skated for about 2 hours and back home had dinner myself then shower.
After that, I have been sitting at my computer doing things I haven’t done so far.
Things finally settling down here at new apartment and my life is getting back to normal.
So I gotta keep move forward again!
