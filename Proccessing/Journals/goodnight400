It’s been a while that I don’t know what to do for rest of the night.
Tonight, I really don’t know what to do.
Got back from work about an hour ago, had pork chop dinner myself(I bought too much last Saturday still have some left in my fridge) and took a shower.
Work was okay same as usual, this week we don’t have a lot going on so we could spend time to research and see other art works or read articles for visual design and user experience.
I enjoy this time cause all those time really have affect on my work.
Still working out on my lunch break and I got down to 155 lb.
5 more pounds to go then I just have to keep it that way.
One of the girls at work tried to talk to me about my hair style which hasn’t been changed at all.
just thought it was weird.
I still have 2 freelance works going on but nothing has to be done today cause I’m waiting for the response for both of them.
Also started working on child theme on Ohsik(the WordPress theme I developed) so it will be more attractive for people to download the theme.
I’m going to move to new apartment next Tuesday but haven’t packed anything yet.
Well I did not even get the boxes which I have to do it be end of this week.
Sounds like a lot going on.
However, I really don’t know what to do for rest of the night.
It’s 8:15 PM and I’m too lazy to go out and my ear infection stops me to go gym for swimming.
I guess I will just go to sleep early.
I always want to make mobile application for GoodNightJournal but still haven’t find the way to do it but for now I’m thinking starting with UI design and keep looking for the way to build it.
Anyways, Goodnight everyone.
