Monday again and I’m writing a diary for it.
I had very typical day; work and work out then run after work lol.
Feels really good after the running and take shower.
Probably the one of the best feeling that human can feel.
It’s 8:10 PM here.
Tonight, I have to work on the project that I have to get it done in two days.
I have been trying to get some ideas for this project for past couple days.
Did quite amount of research and tried to see what others have done.
However, some reason it did not really help me out so far.
Still not sure where I’m going to go with this.
I definitely need more research and planning before I actually get to work on it.
So today, I kind of planned out my protein deal menu very roughly.
Aiming for 60 gram of protein a day and I thinking I’m going to start with chicken breast.
One other thing about websites, thinking about getting two domains.
one for skate group and the other one for health blog.
Well we’ll see.
