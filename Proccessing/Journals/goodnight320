It’s been too cold/raining this week.
I couldn’t go out skating at all from Sunday.
It was good at the beginning cause I needed time to recover my sore muscles but now it just sucks that I can’t go out.
Just hoping this Saturday will be dry and warm which is not on weather forecast lol.
Not much going on lately.
Just work, gym and home as usual.
I have been trying to study more on Front-end development mostly on MVC frameworks.
The more articles or tutorials I see, the more I get confused.
I really need to understand basics first.
I think I’m going to dedicate some of my free time to go through the tutorials from basics so I understand how things work and how to make it work.
It will be fun!
I’m thinking starting from Angular then move on to Javascript since I know some Javascript already.
It’s 9:16PM on my bed.
I’m really sure what to do rest of the night but I know I will just stay home and being relaxed.
Goodnight!
