9:16 PM on Monday night.
Sitting on my couch and writing a diary for today.
I actually started day with good mood cause I had a good sleep last night.
It felt really good to wake up from a good sleep after a long time of not.
I will try to keep this thing going by keeping daily schedule.
It was a typical Monday.
Work and work out on lunch break.
The weather was really nice over 70 degrees.
It just made me feel little bad for not being able to go outside and enjoy the weather.
Well at least I got to enjoy the weather over the weekend by skating in the city for hours.
Got off at 6 PM as usual then drove to Johnâ€™s work to pick him up.
We ended up stopping by Chicago food for grocery and did small Korean BBQ for dinner.
Took a shower after that and trying to spend rest of the night productively
