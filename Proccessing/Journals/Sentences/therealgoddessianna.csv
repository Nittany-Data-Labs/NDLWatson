goodnight113,
goodnight113,This week has been pretty good.
goodnight113,Thursday was my day off.
goodnight113,Went to the city with The Man.
goodnight113,We walked around the mall for awhile.
goodnight113,I bought myself and The Man coordinated necklaces (mine’s a pentagram inside a circle with the zodiac signs enscribed on the stainless steel).
goodnight113,The Man’s necklace is a pentagram too, but it’s darker than mine.
goodnight113,While we were looking at jewelry I spotted a tee shirt with a kitten puking a rainbow.
goodnight113,It screamed Deedee so I got it for her.
goodnight113,She’s wearing it as I write this blog...
goodnight113,Yesterday was Snoochie’s play “The Elephant Child”.
goodnight113,I loved going to her school and watching her sing.
goodnight113,After the performance The Man and I went to Bojangles (best biscuits EVER).
goodnight113,Then we went to the store and got Snoochie a giant stuffed tiger and 2 shirts.
goodnight113,I couldn’t wait til she got home to surprise her.
goodnight113,I worked last night and it was a big boss shift.
goodnight113,It was actually a very pleasant, smooth evening.
goodnight113,It’s awesome when Big Boss is in a good mood.
goodnight113,So that’s been my weekend so far and all in all, it’s been good!
goodnight113,
goodnight94,
goodnight94,Toothless has been on her medication for 3 days now.
goodnight94,I know this won’t cure the cancer nor save her life, but it will ease her pain.
goodnight94,It’s this gut wrenching ironic twist that the medication is making her feel well enough that she’s moving around and she seems... happy.
goodnight94,It’s a false hope.
goodnight94,It feels cruel almost.
goodnight94,She finally feels relief as the sand pours quickly to the bottom of her hour glass.
goodnight94,I see my sweet baby looking at me with her huge, sparkling, yellow eyes and for the first time in a month or more her pain has subsided.
goodnight94,Her life may be short, but now she has a chance to enjoy the few weeks she has left.
goodnight94,Every time I stroke her fur I feel a pang of sorrow.
goodnight94,I’m going to miss this.
goodnight94,I’m going to miss seeing her shadow creep across the house.
goodnight94,I’m going to miss the way she rolls on to her side and lays her head back so I’ll let her neck.
goodnight94,Meeting her was our destiny.
goodnight94,I did not think our time would be so short.
goodnight94,Facing her imminent death I’ve had to ask myself a hard question.
goodnight94,When Toothless’s spirit leaves her body... what do we do with her body?
goodnight94,We can’t bury her because we are planning on moving and we can’t bring her with us.
goodnight94,I refuse to let the vet dispose of her for us.
goodnight94,She won’t be just some anonymous pet handed over to be incinerated with dogs and cats that’s she’s never known.
goodnight94,We have decided on cremation and we want the remains returned.
goodnight94,We will hike as a family to the top of one of the Blue Ridge Mountains and scatter the ashes of the live she lived into the air.
goodnight94,For a cat that spent her life safely protected inside 4 walls, for the cat that lay on the window sill basked in sunshine nothing seems more appropriate than letting her fly off in breeze with the world to roam.
goodnight94,She will be the sky, the stars, and the ground beneath my feet.
goodnight94,I feel this is the good bye my special friend deserves.
goodnight94,I’ve started calling for quotes.
goodnight94,I have to make sure the places that preform this service are creditable and licensed.
goodnight94,It’s a task that hurts my soul, but it’s so important to my family.
goodnight94,
goodnight92,
goodnight92,I’m starting to drift into the fog again.
goodnight92,My brain gets cloudy and thoughts whirl by like a gust of wind.
goodnight92,Sometimes I can’t fight the electric currents of energy that course through my veins.
goodnight92,It’s the ADHD again and I am forever fighting it.
goodnight92,Maybe it’s just that I had a long week end, consumed at work.
goodnight92,Yes, let’s pretend that’s the only reason why the world gets fuzzy and loses its focus.
goodnight92,I had meant for this journal entry to be about Sloth... but ironically I rather not concentrate all of my energy into a singular topic.
goodnight92,Days like today I’m embracing the free flow.
goodnight92,Saturday night at work went well.
goodnight92,I dug the crew we had on.
goodnight92,After work I had to mad dash 4 towns over and pick up The Man from his own place of employment.
goodnight92,We got home and it was well past 1 am so sleep came easily enough.
goodnight92,Sunday morning bright and early I had to be back at work.
goodnight92,The day started with an interesting turn of events.
goodnight92,Big boss took time and care to explain various procedures in depth with me... things that are truthfuly beyond my realm of responsibilities.
goodnight92,I picked up on the vibe, paid careful attention, but said nothing.
goodnight92,Yes, I’m psychic, but that doesn’t always mean I should trust my intuition.
goodnight92,Sure nuff’ 5 minutes (or less later) big boss asked me how I’d feel about being a manager.
goodnight92,I said yes.
goodnight92,So, we will see where this goes.
goodnight92,Once upon a time I was offered a promotion that was eventually denied to me by a combination of factors 1.
goodnight92,I think I accidentally leeched energy from my then big boss.
goodnight92,2.
goodnight92,I was assaulted by my direct supervisor.
goodnight92,I was po’ed.
goodnight92,I pitched a fit.
goodnight92,3.
goodnight92,Good bye promotion.
goodnight92,Gee, how am I suppose to act when some one shows me around like a rag doll!?!?
goodnight92,It’s in the past now.
goodnight92,I’m over it, I swear.
goodnight92,However promotions now are a huge source of anxiety for me.
goodnight92,It’s the carrot dangling in front of the donkey.
goodnight92,Consider me the donkey.
goodnight92,So.
goodnight92,We will see.
goodnight92,I guess I need to stay in good communication with big boss about this and roll up my sleeves, act like a responsible adult.
goodnight92,My diet lately has been so so.
goodnight92,It’s an improvement so call it a baby step.
goodnight92,On the other hand, I have been exercising a lot.
goodnight92,The soreness doesn’t affect me as much.
goodnight92,I plan on sticking with it.
goodnight92,Today was gorgeous outside!!!
goodnight92,Oh my goodness do I love South Carolina.
goodnight92,It felt and smelled like spring.
goodnight92,I just wanted to be under that blazing sun all day.
goodnight92,The air was so warm and sweet.
goodnight92,The Man and I had our breakfast date this morning.
goodnight92,I got my standard egg whites, bacon, wheat toast, and crispy hash browns.
goodnight92,Yum.
goodnight92,We accidentally overheard our waitress telling her boss that her last table couldn’t pay their whole bill and were 80 cents short + tip.
goodnight92,As a former waitress I took this opportunity to make good on all the fabulous tips I’ve been fortunate enough to receive.
goodnight92,I hope that made our lovely server’s Monday morning a little better.
goodnight92,So... I think that wraps up my past few days.
goodnight92,My tummy is hurting me a little at the moment so I should probably head to bed.
goodnight92,Good night world!

goodnight125,Let me start my next ghost story / tale of the big red house with a brief over view about doppelgangers because it is extremely relevant to my own encounter.
goodnight125,Doppelganger
goodnight125,
goodnight125, 
goodnight125, 
goodnight125,A doppelganger is an extremely rare paranormal phenomenon.
goodnight125,The majority of paranormal groups will never become involved in a doppelganger case, but it is one in which we should mention because as rare as it is – it does happen from time to time.
goodnight125,A doppelganger is a physical double of a living person.
goodnight125,The word is derived from German meaning “double walker”.
goodnight125,The term has expanded beyond the paranormal realm and it has become a word to refer to any look-alike of any person.
goodnight125,In paranormal terms, it has a much more mysterious meaning.
goodnight125,Most doppelgangers are experienced when someone catches an image of themselves in their peripheral vision.
goodnight125,In older times, to see your own doppelganger was an omen of your impending death.
goodnight125,(Wasn’t everything a bad omen back then?)
goodnight125,Your doppelganger seen by a friend or family was also considered bad luck and an omen of an approaching illness.
goodnight125,Again in folklore, a doppelganger cast no shadow or reflection and was supposed to advise the person they shadow – often providing misleading and malicious messages.
goodnight125,You may be asking why we are discussing this if this topic was the result of old folklore.
goodnight125,While the folklore seems to be preposterous, there are recorded events of doppelgangers that baffle not only paranormal investigators – but family members and in some instances police officers.
goodnight125,A doppelganger can be the result of energy that a live person has expended that has somehow been recorded and replays itself – like a residual haunting, only with the energy of a live person.
goodnight125,There are many reports of people being haunted by their likenesses reliving some traumatic event in their own lives.
goodnight125,There are also claims of doppelgangers that appear responsive and have an inkling of intelligence to them.
goodnight125,How this occurs is a mystery for all of us.
goodnight125,It is a relatively rare phenomenon and one that needs further research.
goodnight125,A very real possibility for a doppelganger image is a crisis apparition.
goodnight125,A crisis apparition is an image of a living person who is usually in grave danger or injury.
goodnight125,They are able to subconsciously reach out to loved ones, often times many miles away.
goodnight125,The above info is from a site, I’ll give credit to at the end of this post.
goodnight125,Now, let’s go back in time to my childhood and the massive red house I grew up in.
goodnight125,My mom was rather strict with bedtime, but her perfect routine of bath time and then a story before lights out worked like a charm.
goodnight125,After my mom tucked me into my bed, I always STAYED in bed.
goodnight125,My mom would go downstairs after putting my siblings and me to bed.
goodnight125,She’d clean up the kitchen, living room, and playroom, and then relax and watch tv.
goodnight125,Her favorite arm chair was pushed up against the living room wall only inches a way from the door way between the living room and kitchen.
goodnight125,She’d sit in her chair, enjoying her program, only to be interrupted from her leisure by the sound of children’s laughter coming from the kitchen.
goodnight125,“Go to bed,” she’d warn the mischievous children assuming it was my siblings and me, out of bed, and up to no good.
goodnight125,The laughter and patter of little feet running around the kitchen would continue.
goodnight125,My mom would scold “us” a couple of more times before she’d get up to force us to go back upstairs to bed.
goodnight125,As the children came into her peripheral vision, they’d vanish in thin air before she could approach them.
goodnight125,She could never quite tell about 2 of the children and their likeness to that of my sister and brother, but the third spectral was a dead ringer for me.
goodnight125,However, I can assure you that when my mom put me to bed at night, I stayed in bed.
goodnight125,I never got up.
goodnight125,I never went down stairs.
goodnight125,As I’ve mentioned in a previous story, those stairs terrified me.
goodnight125,I would never want to venture down them at night, in the dark.
goodnight125,When I was young, I had developed a bad habit of running off to my neighbors house to play with my best friend.
goodnight125,I was notorious for taking off, leaving without a grown up, or letting my parents know where I was going.
goodnight125,One day while my older siblings were at school, I was home alone with my mom.
goodnight125,I don’t remember much about that day.
goodnight125,I assume I was playing with legos or some other toy in my playroom.
goodnight125,My mom was busy cleaning the house.
goodnight125,At some point I slipped away and ran up the street to see if I could play with my friend.
goodnight125,My mom didn’t notice that yet again, I’d taken off.
goodnight125,She went down to the basement to use the washing machine and dryer we had stacked up on pallets down there.
goodnight125,As she loaded the washing machine facing the wall, she heard the giggling and laughter of a small child.
goodnight125,She assumed it to be me since I was the only one home with her.
goodnight125,She spoke to me with loving words of what a mom would usually say to a 3 or 4 year old child.
goodnight125,She felt my small arms wrap around her, hugging her.
goodnight125,Then with such force that no small child could possibly exude, “I” shoved her forward, causing her body to slam up against the washing machine.
goodnight125,She said she could hear me laughing and saw my backside as I ran into my father’s workshop, which was really just a hidden room in the basement.
goodnight125,At one point in the house’s history this room had been completely sealed off.
goodnight125,My mom ran up the stairs, slammed the door shut behind her, and dead bolted it shut.
goodnight125,She yelled through the closed door that I couldn’t come out until I said “sorry”.
goodnight125,For the next hour she heard me up on the basement stairs, behind the door, kicking at it, screaming my head off.
goodnight125,That’s when the phone rang.
goodnight125,Even as my neighbor had explained to my mom that I had been at her house for the past two hours and she just realized I didn’t tell my mom I’d taken off, my mom could still hear me screaming on the stairs.
goodnight125,What really spooked her was she could also hear me in the back round, at my neighbors house.
goodnight125,When my mom hung up the phone, she was chilled to the bone.
goodnight125,All at once the racket “I” was making stopped and the house was silent around her.
goodnight125,My mom is a very religious person.
goodnight125,After that day there was always a bottle of holy water on top of the washing machine.
goodnight125,I once asked my mom why it was there, hesitantly she told me this story.
goodnight125,I should pause right here to let you know that my mom was NOT the type of person to tell ghost stories or say anything about the house that might scare me.
goodnight125,If anything she totally played down any of the numerous scary encounters we experienced.
goodnight125,I didn’t even feel comfortable talking to my mom when something paranormal seeming went down.
goodnight125,During the time we lived in this house, my sister was the only one I’d confide it because she was the only one who didn’t use the “your imagination is running away with you” excuse.
goodnight125,When I was in 6th grade, I took a bus home from school everyday.
goodnight125,My older sister went to different school and she always came home before me.
goodnight125,Every school day was the same routine.
goodnight125,At 3:30 the bus would drop me off.
goodnight125,I’d run straight up stairs to use the bathroom (I never used the bathrooms at school if I could help it).
goodnight125,After I relieved myself, I’d go downstairs to get a snack and watch some tv.
goodnight125,One day, it seemed like any other, I ran off the bus, through the house, and up to the bathroom.
goodnight125,“Hi!
goodnight125,I’m home” I said to my sister as I passed by her room on the way to the bathroom.
goodnight125,I did my business and as I passed by her own my way back down stairs, I realized she looked very freaked out.
goodnight125,“What’s wrong?” I asked.
goodnight125,My sister explained to me that apparently, I had already came home from school.
goodnight125,I did what I always did... sort off.
goodnight125,She heard me come into the house through the back door.
goodnight125,She heard me run up the stairs.
goodnight125,She saw me pass by her room on my way to the bathroom.
goodnight125,She heard me go into the bathroom.
goodnight125,She even heard the toilet flush.
goodnight125,The only “off” thing was that when I was done, I went into my bedroom and shut the door instead of going back down stairs to watch tv, like I always do.
goodnight125,About 10 minutes later while I was “supposedly” went in my room, she heard the school bus stop outside our house.
goodnight125,She checked her watch.
goodnight125,It was 3:30, the usual time I made it home by.
goodnight125,She got really scared when she saw me from her window getting off the bus and walking up to the house.
goodnight125,She was positive I had already been home and was in my room.
goodnight125,My sister swears up and down it wasn’t a dream nor was it a case of deja-vu.
goodnight125,The thing is, I was really terrified of the 2nd floor of the house.
goodnight125,I only went upstairs to use the bathroom or when I had to be in my room for bed.
goodnight125,Never did I go in my room to do school work or hang out, unless I had a friend over.
goodnight125,I refused to even close the door to my room because being in the room with my door shut made me feel like I was in the room with something else.
goodnight125,As a kid, I tried to spend as little time as humanly possible away from the 2nd floor.
goodnight125,Years later I loved to read anything on paranormal activity... I stumbled upon doppelganger lore.
goodnight125,It seems to fit.
goodnight125,I’ve never seen my doppelganger, but my mom and sister have.
goodnight125,I wonder if an entity mimicked me or was it some glitch in time.
goodnight125,I guess I’ll never really know.
goodnight125,Oh and here’s the link to doppelganger info: http://manchesterparanormal.org/Doppelganger.php

goodnight127,I am an empty cup and music is my drink.
goodnight127,I always have a tune stuck in my head.
goodnight127,Music is something that I am very passionate about.
goodnight127,I can find a song for every occasion.
goodnight127,So many memories of different chapters of my life play through my mind when I hear a specific song.
goodnight127,“Don’t want to miss a thing” by Aerosmith reminds me of my first true love.
goodnight127,“Glycerine” by Bush reminds me of my first serious boyfriend
goodnight127,“I saw the sign” by Ace of Base.
goodnight127,It’s the first CD I ever owned (You can stop laughing now.
goodnight127,We all make poor choices).
goodnight127,“Yesterday” by the Beatles calls to mind a time when I was brave.
goodnight127,I had to sing it by myself in front of the entire chorus to audition to sing it for a concert.
goodnight127,Yes, I was terrible.
goodnight127,No, I didn’t get the part.
goodnight127,I was the only person who volunteered to do it though.
goodnight127,No one raised a hand until after I sang my little heart out and revealed just how tone deaf I am.
goodnight127,After I finished, everyone else’s hands shot up.
goodnight127,“If Inanna can stand up there alone and sing like a dieing crow, so can I!”
goodnight127,“Under the bridge” by The Red Hot Chili Peppers.
goodnight127,I said my first “I love you” to The Man while we were listening to this song.
goodnight127,I snuck it with the lyrics.
goodnight127,He had already told me “I love you” the day before, but I held out until I was positive.
goodnight127,“Run Around” by Blue’s Travelers was playing on the radio when I went bungee jumping.
goodnight127,“I’m yours” by Jason Miraz was the song played at my best friend’s funeral
goodnight127,“Like a Prayer” by Madonna.
goodnight127,It’s the anthem of my childhood.
goodnight127,I’ll always remind warm summer nights, running around in my back yard, and the sweet smell of fresh cut grass.
goodnight127,“Hey You” by Pink Floyd.
goodnight127,My all time favorite song.
goodnight127,“Never Dreamed” by Black Label Society brings back the pain of when The Man and I broke up.
goodnight127,I’d listen to it over and over desperately hoping that it reflected his inner feelings.
goodnight127,“The Rain in Africa” by Toto.
goodnight127,Best inside joke EVER.
goodnight127,I could add a hundred more songs to the list, more of my favorites, ones I can’t stand.
goodnight127,There is a song for every occasion in my life.
goodnight127,I think this sums up most of the significant ones. 
goodnight127,

goodnight86,A few days ago The Man and I needed to go to the library the other day to fax some paper work.
goodnight86,While we were hanging out at the check out counter waiting to make sure everything went through one of our favorite librarians came over to chat.
goodnight86,During the conversation the librarian thanked The Man for his donation.
goodnight86,I had no clue what he was talking about.
goodnight86,When we left the library I asked The Man about it.
goodnight86,Sheepishly he told me that he gave them $25 on his last visit.
goodnight86,I couldn’t stop from grinning.
goodnight86,The Man selflessly gave and had made no mention of it.
goodnight86,He didn’t do it for acknowledgement.
goodnight86,He did it to help a worthy cause.
goodnight86,Then I thought about it.
goodnight86,The other day I was trying to open Google man’s in his phone.
goodnight86,I accidentally opened his FB messenger instead.
goodnight86,I saw a messenger from his friend’s little sister, again thanking him.
goodnight86,I asked him about it and it turns out he donated some money to her gofundme account so she can raise the funds to go to college.
goodnight86,He thought she’d put the assistance to good use.
goodnight86,I am with a man who is strong, smart, and kind.
goodnight86,He is giving.
goodnight86,He is helpful.
goodnight86,He does none of this for himself.
goodnight86,He does it to help others out there who need it.
goodnight86,I know he doesn’t do it for my approval, but my pride in him is through the roof.
goodnight86,It’s all these thousand and one things that spark and pop about him that make me grin ear to ear.
goodnight86,We’ve both been working a lot lately and I miss him, but I’m glad that he leaves me with such pleasant thoughts.
goodnight86,With him not only do I feel loved, but I know that I am loved.
goodnight86,

goodnight112,With Bobo at his grandparents house for the week end, it was up to The Man and I to entertain the girls.
goodnight112,I had wanted to get out and about today, hoping to hike up Table Rock.
goodnight112,I know bringing the girls for that level of a hike would only end up being a nightmare.
goodnight112,No biggy though.
goodnight112,We are semi new to this area and we, as a family, love to explore!
goodnight112,So I looked up some near by must-see destinations, was in awe of the beauty of yellow branch falls, plugged the address into my g.p.s.
goodnight112,and away we went.
goodnight112,Estimated arrival time was only 2 hours a way.
goodnight112,Perfect.
goodnight112,With car ride tunes and snacks we drove through the country.
goodnight112,The scenery was to die for!
goodnight112,We saw a zillion plantation style houses and farms.
goodnight112,I spotted every type of cow conceivable, donkeys, rabbits, chickens, horses, llamas, rabbits, dogs, cats, even a fox!
goodnight112,We rode up mountains.
goodnight112,I felt like I was lost among the clouds.
goodnight112,Turns out though I plugged the address of the state park and NOT the trail the waterfall was on.
goodnight112,We couldn’t find it, but we weren’t disappointed.
goodnight112,We saw quite a few waterfalls, creeks, streams, rapids.
goodnight112,Trees of all shapes and sizes surrounded us.
goodnight112,We drove through tight winding roads and I’d hold my breath.
goodnight112,The girls made me laugh so hard that tears slid down my cheeks.
goodnight112,Without meaning too, we drove in a huge loop through the mountain roads.
goodnight112,We passed by the trail for Yellow Branch Waterfall on our way back towards home (and more importantly dinner – we were starving!)
goodnight112,We parked and looked around, but the hike to the waterfall is about 3.5 miles.
goodnight112,We were too hungry for even that.
goodnight112,At least now I know where to go.
goodnight112,So be prepared.
goodnight112,I’m going back!
goodnight112,Another adventure for another day.
goodnight112,It’s not really about the destination, it’s the journey that you really remember   
goodnight112,
goodnight107,
goodnight107,I’m hopelessly addicted to the news.
goodnight107,For me it is important to know all about the world around me.
goodnight107,No topic is too bland.
goodnight107,I like to read through local news, national news, health, world news, science, politics.
goodnight107,No topic is off limits for my thirsty mind.
goodnight107,I like to keep current.
goodnight107,Keeping my head in the sand isn’t an option for me.
goodnight107,With my quest for knowledge comes a huge price.
goodnight107,Many news sites (and network stations (*cough* Fox) have lost their objective ways and subtly slip in their own opinion.
goodnight107,What happened to an unbiased delivery?
goodnight107,So for me to try to find the true story I need to work twice as hard.
goodnight107,First I read the major sites and then... the conspiracy theories.
goodnight107,I believe the truth lies some where in the middle.
goodnight107,Another devastating side effect caused from following too many real life news stories is all the loss, all the pain, all the tragedy.
goodnight107,ISIS, Taliban, and Syria are all too familiar to us.
goodnight107,It’s one thing to read a story about the terrorism, the civil war, the chemical warfare, migrants and refugees trying to flee, but it’s another thing to imagine myself as one of them.
goodnight107,Truly terrifying and heart breaking.
goodnight107,Why do we kill each other?!?!
goodnight107,Why?
goodnight107,We have mass shootings like the recent Kalamazoo rampage.
goodnight107,Can you imagine taking your son to buy his 1st New car when suddenly you are gunned down simply for being in the wrong place at the exact wrong time.
goodnight107,That’s not destiny!!!
goodnight107,It’s sickening and cruel.
goodnight107,What about the Flint water?
goodnight107,A whole town being poisoned by the very water they pay for to drink, bath in, do laundry, etc.
goodnight107,These poor people have led poisoning among other things.
goodnight107,Can you imagine not being able to get yourself a glass of water out of your kitchen sink?
goodnight107,Let me not forget to mention what this has done to the value of their homes and businesses.
goodnight107,This has been going on for the past 2 years.
goodnight107,It’s only been brought to light in the past 6 months.
goodnight107,Humanity has begun to lose its ways.
goodnight107,The senseless and selfishness of it all lashes fiercely against my soul.
goodnight107,So let’s make a change with the means we have available to us.
goodnight107,Let’s pass kindness on.
goodnight107,Open doors FOR EVERYONE, yes even the teenager.
goodnight107,Let’s take the time to say “hello” with a smile on our face.
goodnight107,Pay for the meal of the person behind you in line.
goodnight107,Let’s do good things for others so that maybe in the depths of their own personal sorrows, we can be the beam of light.
goodnight107,

goodnight115,Oh my stars, my sweet Sam... I thought of you today.
goodnight115,It broke my heart as I poured through the “what it’s.” Sam, my sweet beautiful Sam.
goodnight115,What can I possibly say to you?
goodnight115,What is it that you need?
goodnight115,What is it that I can possibly give to you?
goodnight115,I swear to you this, my Sam.
goodnight115,I love you.
goodnight115,I always have and I always will.
goodnight115,You are mine.
goodnight115,I am yours.
goodnight115,My arms ache to hold you.
goodnight115,My eyes ache to see you.
goodnight115,Please my darling, please understand that I wish for a life you could have been a part of.
goodnight115,You were always wanted.
goodnight115,You were always loved.
goodnight115,I would have done everything to keep you.
goodnight115,Sam... I know the sacrifice you made.
goodnight115,It was her or you.
goodnight115,You chose her.
goodnight115,I cannot thank you enough.
goodnight115,Did you know?
goodnight115,So small and yet you knew the potential of the future?
goodnight115,Did you know that she understands?
goodnight115,She honors you.
goodnight115,She loves you too.
goodnight115,She knows you played your part through and through.
goodnight115,She sees you, Sam, even when I can not.
goodnight115,You look after her.
goodnight115,You watch her.
goodnight115,Why did you think she was more valuable than you?
goodnight115,Sam, do you see the price of your sacrifice and does it give you pride?
goodnight115,My fate, her fate, your fate, I see it all twisted together.
goodnight115,Sam, what can I give you that is just yours?
goodnight115,I know that you’ve never had it fair nor easy.
goodnight115,Sam-I-am, my precious boy, you are a prince amongst princes.
goodnight115,I would trade my life for yours.
goodnight115,I love you forever and always.
goodnight115,How can I show you that even though I never got the chance to hold you that you are indeed in my arms, in my heart, and amongst the stars above my head.
goodnight115,Whether you are physical or not, you are mine Sam.
goodnight115,I love you.
goodnight115,I miss you.
goodnight115,You are precious.
goodnight115,Most of all, I am sorry.
goodnight115,Some how, I failed you.
goodnight115,I can not let it go.
goodnight115,I would trade my life for a single minute with you.
goodnight115,I would kiss you on the cheek and again, in between your eyes.
goodnight115,My arms would hold you close.
goodnight115,Tears would roll down my cheeks.
goodnight115,Please, oh please remember my sweet boy, you are gone, but never forgotten. 
goodnight115,
goodnight88,
goodnight88,My shoulders ache and hunch forward.
goodnight88,My eyes blur and through the lenses everything seems hazy and blurry.
goodnight88,Pulses beat timidly through the bottoms of my feet.
goodnight88,My skin is practically screaming.
goodnight88,I am so very, very physically tired.
goodnight88,Work has taken a lot out of me this week and the torture sessions are no where near over.
goodnight88,I don’t know what’s worse when my body steps into methodical mode or when my brain checks out rendering me an imbecile.
goodnight88,It’s brutal and defeating.
goodnight88,I am scheduled for a 6 hour shift tomorrow and *sigh* that’s my short day.
goodnight88,Usually I’m endless energy and perky to a fault.
goodnight88,Seems I’ve used it all up today.
goodnight88,Faking being sincere isn’t as easy as it once was.
goodnight88,Tomorrow will be an gorgeous day and I’ll be locked in my cage facing fierce scrutiny and feeling like a failure under it all.
goodnight88,Maybe I’ll feel better after I sleep.
goodnight88,Hard to close my eyes when my brain is spinning.
goodnight88,
goodnight144,
goodnight144,I’ve been growing aware of it since I’ve settled into the south and my new house.
goodnight144,I never dreamed something so petty would irk me so much... but I’m skinny with a gut.
goodnight144,Not working and consuming way too much junk food is really taking its toll on my body.
goodnight144,So now that I’ve identified the problem, I can either correct it or start buying bigger pants.
goodnight144,To be honest, I don’t want to accept this as the new me.
goodnight144,New Years seems like a good time to lay down a resolution.
goodnight144,After January 1st, I think it’s time to say good bye to soda and the rest of junk food I so love.
goodnight144,I’d also like to work out a bit more.
goodnight144,
goodnight141,
goodnight141,Oh where, oh where do I start?
goodnight141,It hasn’t been a particularly busy or interesting week, but my goal is to stay current with my life... even if it’s basic by ALL standards.
goodnight141,The most worthy event was Deedee’s birthday.
goodnight141,We bestowed upon her monster, cosmic brownies, a phone card, and some make up.
goodnight141,Nothing major except she’s 14 and in four years she will be a young adult.
goodnight141,Holy cow.
goodnight141,Revelations like this make me want to freeze time.
goodnight141,Her big ticket item scored will be tickets to Warp Tour, but since that doesn’t take place until March, I’ve no choice but to give it belated.
goodnight141,Bobo got sent home with a notice from the school nurse.
goodnight141,They’re suggesting he has a astigmatism and there for will need corrective eye wear.
goodnight141,I’m shocked Bobo will be my first spawn to wear glasses, but I’m not surprised by the suspected diagnosis.
goodnight141,Like mother like son.
goodnight141,Is it wrong that I think he’ll like great with four eyes?!?!
goodnight141,I’m looking forward to his eye exam.
goodnight141,Even though I secretly can’t wait to see him sporting glasses, I am concerned about him losing them or breaking them in the future.
goodnight141,This is Bobo we’re talking about after all.
goodnight141,Nothing big on the Snoochie front other than I showed her how to make dream catchers so she is spending her day off from school crafting away.
goodnight141,Took the man out to El Pablano on Saturday night.
goodnight141,I got a big ol’ margarita and the tres amigos (steak, chicken and shrimp grilled to perfection served over pineapple and covered in some sort of yummy white cheese).
goodnight141,I never thought I’d love Mexican food so much... but yeah, I do.
goodnight141,It’s amazeballs.
goodnight141,Date night was a five star event although The Man’s been under the weather for a week now so I’m sure that made the night slightly less enjoyable for him.
goodnight141,I hope he perks up soon.
goodnight141,I cheated on my no soda diet, but it was a small cheat.
goodnight141,I got Code Red, just ONE 2 liter and to be completely honest I don’t regret it.
goodnight141,This doesn’t mean I’m going back to my old ways... it just means I indulged.
goodnight141,Cranky boss hasn’t been too cranky and work has been pretty good over all.
goodnight141,I really can’t complain about my employment.
goodnight141,I like spending my pay checks.
goodnight141,With that, I think I’ve summed my week up except for maybe this: Who steals chairs from a restaurant... seriously....
goodnight141,Lmfao!
goodnight141,
goodnight91,
goodnight91,Note: So this particular entry is inevitably going to be quite long.
goodnight91,It’s a story I’ve been working on.
goodnight91,I will not be posting sections of it in different entries.
goodnight91,The entire story will be posted all in this specific blog.
goodnight91,So if you choose to follow along this is the only place you’ll find it.
goodnight91,Feel free to leave comments and critics for me to review.
goodnight91,I rarely finish my stories so perhaps feedback will help get me in gear to complete this one.
goodnight91,Hopefully you like it although I’ll be the first to admit, it may not be for everyone.
goodnight91,*******************************************************************
goodnight91,Chapter 1.
goodnight91,The vast, wild jungle forest rose up from nowhere, standing mightily next to the barren, scorched desert.
goodnight91,The edges of the dusty sand were naturally guarded by tall, lush, vividly green trees and brush.
goodnight91,Members of a remote, secret tribe hid among the canopy and down below in the thorny tangles of shrubbery.
goodnight91,For hundreds of years it had been their sacred duty to keep watch on all of the entrances to the jungle, protecting the ancient race of humanoid creatures that lived within.
goodnight91,It was a particularly important time to be vigilant.
goodnight91,The Queen was ripe and could birth at any given moment.
goodnight91,This would be her second known offspring.
goodnight91,She had already bore a son, but it was known that he would not be entitled to inherit the powerful, but modest kingdom.
goodnight91,In this strange land it was the female of the species who reigned supreme.
goodnight91,While the males of this mysterious race, the Lilim, were almost always physically stronger, their psychic powers tended to be inferior than that of their female counterparts.
goodnight91,The females exuded more patience, wisdom, cunning minds despite ruling with vicious iron fists when necessary.
goodnight91,Ages upon ages ago in a time forgotten to most, the ruling Queen had made a pact with the natives of the jungle.
goodnight91,In exchange for the villagers labor, protection, and dedication to the strange, beautiful, angelic-like race the natives flourished.
goodnight91,There was no more sickness nor hunger.
goodnight91,The Lilim showed a great respect to the villagers.
goodnight91,It was considered a serious crime to take advantage of any of them.
goodnight91,The Queen had insisted the relationship must always be in balance.
goodnight91,The humans prospered under the rule and guidance of this strange race.
goodnight91,Esi hid high in the canopy of the trees.
goodnight91,He gazed far out into the blindingly bright, barren desert.
goodnight91,It was his assignment to guard the entrances leading into the jungle.
goodnight91,He had much help with this important task, but rarely did anything give him the need to actually rise to action.
goodnight91,No battles with foreign enemies to protect the Lilim or his own people.
goodnight91,The desert, the jungle, and thus the kingdom hid in a remote corner of the Earth where outsiders seldom wandered.
goodnight91,The young guardian knew he should stay focused and alert, but the anticipation and excitement of the upcoming birth proved to be a great distraction.
goodnight91,Desperately he wanted to see the infant.
goodnight91,The first time the Queen had given birth had been extremely disappointing although Ex I would never admit it.
goodnight91,It had been less than a decade ago since the fateful day Prince Bael had entered this world.
goodnight91,Several hours after the announcement of his birth villagers and Lilim alike crowded together in the court yards below the golden temple eagerly awaiting the High Priestess, Cecelia to present the infant for all to behold and revere.
goodnight91,Esi, a child then, did not have to work or stand guard that day.
goodnight91,He was among those in attendance for the ceremony.
goodnight91,He remembered the sights and sounds with vivid clarity.
goodnight91,The Queen, who never aged a single day, ascended the temple stairs at a slow, steady pace.
goodnight91,Her long violet dress robes fluttered and danced in the breeze.
goodnight91,She carried a swaddled bundle tightly in her arms.
goodnight91,Her creamy, pale skin looked like marble, except for her cheeks which glowed with more color to them than usual.
goodnight91,Following behind Queen Lilith walked the High Priestess, who maintained a precise distance of three steps back.
goodnight91,When the two women reached the ceremonial day on top of the temple, the Queen turned to face Cecelia and placed the small bundle into her arms.
goodnight91,
goodnight100,
goodnight100,I will not cave.
goodnight100,I will not relent.
goodnight100,I will not bow down.
goodnight100,My will is stronger than many other forces on this Earth.
goodnight100,It’s time for me to channel it and prove to myself that I have what it takes.
goodnight100,Today was day three in my new routine.
goodnight100,I woke up sore and stiff from yesterday’s work.
goodnight100,I dealt with the pain by enjoying a hot cup of good coffee, a steamy shower, and 2 Aleve.
goodnight100,I eased my way slowly into my work out.
goodnight100,Yoga was a perfect start.
goodnight100,Next I did some steps.
goodnight100,I have terrible rhythm, but steps are my favorite part of the routine.
goodnight100,Jogging followed next, then alternating lunges.
goodnight100,It’s a little breezy outside and the air is crisp and slightly cold.
goodnight100,The Man and I went for a short walk.
goodnight100,When we got back home I did two dance routines.
goodnight100,Total work out time is probably around 45 minutes to an hour.
goodnight100,I’m debating adding on 15 – 20 minutes before dinner.
goodnight100,My legs really ache.
goodnight100,I’m positive if I continue and work through the pain that I will grow accustomed to it.
goodnight100,Fluid movement will happen once more.
goodnight100,We have too much junk food in this house.
goodnight100,Next time I go grocery shopping I need to skip the snack section and hang out with the fruits and veggies.
goodnight100,I wish I had my bike still.
goodnight100,I love cycling.
goodnight100,It’s low impact on my knees and yet it’s a highly effective work out.
goodnight100,I’m adding a new bike to my wish list.
goodnight100,I deserve it after all.
goodnight100,Not too mention on nice days I can bike to work.
goodnight100,That’d be useful on days when I’m too busy for a longer work out.
goodnight100,I don’t know why people bother with treadmills.
goodnight100,They’re expensive and you can just as easily walk around outside.
goodnight100,Sunshine is a natural antidepressant and it’s free.
goodnight100,I really don’t see a point in wasting my hard earned money on a gym membership when I can creatively come up with a work out that’s just as effective.
goodnight100,This weekend I’ll be at work for most of it.
goodnight100,Unfortunate the brunt of my weekly hours have been allotted for Saturday and Sunday.
goodnight100,No time for hiking.
goodnight100,When my schedule clears up I’ll have to plan a hike for The Man and me.
goodnight100,He’s been getting the hiking bug too.
goodnight100,Can I just say one more time how awesome it is that my partner and I have so many things we are both interested in.
goodnight100,
goodnight114,
goodnight114,It’s chilly outside today.
goodnight114,Right now at this very moment, I’m in my bed all snug and cozy.
goodnight114,The whistle from a train cries out in the distance.
goodnight114,I’m a little surprised by how much the temperature dropped since yesterday.
goodnight114,I can feel spring inching closer and closer.
goodnight114,It’s just around the corner and I simply can not wait.
goodnight114,Our house may be tiny, too many people packed in tight cramp quarters, but our back yard is quite big.
goodnight114,Spindly trees stretch up in the middle while large bushes guard the parameter.
goodnight114,The yard itself could use a good raking, lots of leaves cling to the Earth.
goodnight114,I’ve meant to spend more time back there, but it’s been such a busy year.
goodnight114,My plan is to make the backyard my sanctuary.
goodnight114,I’ve started buzzing in the man’s ear about digging a fire pit.
goodnight114,So I need to add a rake and shovel to my ever growing wish list.
goodnight114,I’d love to buy a stone bench and set up an alter... but my privacy from the neighbors is compromised.
goodnight114,There are a few gaps in the bushes and I can catch glimpses of the apartment complex that’s on the street behind us.
goodnight114,On sunny days I can hear the loud laughter of my neighbors and well I wouldn’t want them to get the wrong idea.
goodnight114,The approach of warm weather is coming quick.
goodnight114,Some little white flowers that remind me of bells have already started to bloom.
goodnight114,They remind me that I am miserably failing my diet.
goodnight114,Seriously.
goodnight114,I had a deep dish pepperoni pizza with a bacon stuffed crust today for lunch.
goodnight114,It was delicious.
goodnight114,Food is finally getting the best of me.
goodnight114,I have these visions of me in cute sun dresses and my hair down.
goodnight114,Basically what I want is the exact opposite of my nature.
goodnight114,I love jeans, tee shirts, and hoodie sweatshirts.
goodnight114,I have the fashion sense of a 13 year old boy.
goodnight114,I NEED to lose this stupid gut and accumulate a wardrobe worthy of the lil’ goddess I am.
goodnight114,Masquerading around as a bummy teenager has gone on for far too long.
goodnight114,What else is going on these days... Deedee went on her S.T.E.M.
goodnight114,field trip today.
goodnight114,She had a great time and for once school wasn’t “boring”.
goodnight114,She has a field trip to your some colleges coming up next month.
goodnight114,She ate way too much sugar today and was play fighting with Snoochie.
goodnight114,Speaking of Snoochie, she is running for student body government next year.
goodnight114,She’ll be in 6th grade.
goodnight114,I hate how fast time is going.
goodnight114,She also brought home a brochure for band.
goodnight114,She wants to join.
goodnight114,I’m excited.
goodnight114,I’m hoping she’ll play the clarinet like the man and I.
goodnight114,Certainly would be easier for us to offer her assistance if she picks an instrument we both have experience with.
goodnight114,Bobo is Bobo and doesn’t have too much going on other than the fact that I need to buzz his head soon.
goodnight114,I’m planning on getting him a paint ball gun.
goodnight114,I think he will love it!!!
goodnight114,Recently spring cleaned the house and I’m happy with how orderly everything is.
goodnight114,I gave Jake and Andy bathes today.
goodnight114,Those boys are so cute covered in suds!
goodnight114,I think I’m finally winning the battle of the fleas.
goodnight114,The war was long, but I will prevail.
goodnight114,I guess that sums up everything going on around here.
goodnight114,If it’s warm tomorrow I think I’ll go for a run.
goodnight114,
goodnight149,
goodnight149,Toothless, as usual, spent much of the day in her corner near my bed.
goodnight149,I hate seeing her a shell of her former self.
goodnight149,I’m hoping with lots of TLC and her medications she can pull through this.
goodnight149,Deedee and I brought her outside for a lil’ mandatory exercise and change of scenery.
goodnight149,Toothless’s body posture appeared to have improved some what, maybe I am just being hopeful.
goodnight149,Tonight Andy was especially playful.
goodnight149,He really wanted to make friends with Toothless.
goodnight149,He got on his back and wiggled up to Toothless.
goodnight149,She whipped her tail at him.
goodnight149,He thought it was invitation to play.
goodnight149,It wasn’t.
goodnight149,It was a warning he over looked.
goodnight149,Toothless reached out, hissed, and sunk her claws into poor Andy’s paw.
goodnight149,He’s okay, but she did get him really good.
goodnight149,Luckily Andy is such a lovey boy, I know this squirmish won’t get him down.
goodnight149,
goodnight146,
goodnight146,I really don’t have that much to say tonight, I think.
goodnight146,Work seems to be getting better.
goodnight146,Sure, it’ll have it’s ups and downs, but that’s just how life goes.
goodnight146,No such thing as a perfect barrel of apples, right?
goodnight146,All in all, I like it.
goodnight146,I will adjust.
goodnight146,I will adapt.
goodnight146,I will strive to succeed.
goodnight146,The soda free year is still in gear.
goodnight146,I can’t believe I’m passing up soda.
goodnight146,I’m positive such a small (and yet huge to me) change will really benefit me in the long run.
goodnight146,No more am I guzzling caffeinated, artificially colored, fizzy, liquid sugar.
goodnight146,Now would be a good time to mention that not only am I slimming down my waist line, but I’m improving my skin.
goodnight146,Once no soda becomes the no thought involved norm for me, I should figure out the next bad habit to give up... baby steps.
goodnight146,My diet has been more nutritionally substantial too.
goodnight146,Today’s lunch was spring mix, baby kale, onions, apples with balsamic vinaigrette drizzled on top.
goodnight146,Dinner was spaghetti, but the pasta was whole wheat.
goodnight146,My baby has really been supportive in all of this, although he keeps making it a point to say he enjoys the new curves.
goodnight146,On a side note, the kids go back to school tomorrow.
goodnight146,They are less than thrilled.
goodnight146,
goodnight130,
goodnight130,Hi there!
goodnight130,Can you answer a quick question for me?
goodnight130,Just use the first thought that comes to mind and please don’t Google it.
goodnight130,Here’s the question: What color is the opposite of red?
goodnight130,So simply I know and yet, it was the meat and potatoes of a serious debate at my house tonight.
goodnight130,My husband thinks it’s one color and I think it’s a different one.
goodnight130,I’m curious as to who’s answer is the more popular choice.
goodnight130,I won’t say who said what though (maybe you’d be bias if you had prior knowledge of our answers)
goodnight130,Thanks for your help in this 
goodnight130,
goodnight89,
goodnight89,Today was a beautiful day.
goodnight89,I know technically it is winter, but it feels and smells like spring.
goodnight89,The sky today was such a bright, light blue with billowy clouds stretched out as far as the eye could see.
goodnight89,The Man and I went out some place new (to us) for breakfast.
goodnight89,While the scenery was great, I wasn’t impressed with the food nor the service.
goodnight89,Very ordinary and cold.
goodnight89,I’ll take the sweethearts down at Waffle House anytime over stiff service.
goodnight89,After our weekly breakfast date we went to the Auto Store.
goodnight89,I got a deco- air freshener (skull dog tags), steering wheel cover (also skulls), and a new knob for the Stang’s gear shift (a skull... shocking).
goodnight89,We also got all the goodies to regularly clean and detail both of our cars.
goodnight89,I’m off of work tonight.
goodnight89,Nice to spend the evening with my babies.
goodnight89,Deedee showed off her culinary skills and cooked us spaghetti.
goodnight89,Now we have already watched a movie and the kids are getting their evening chores done before bedtime.
goodnight89,Snoochie is washing the dinner dishes.
goodnight89,Bobo is cleaning the cat box.
goodnight89,I tend not to give them money straight out for their chores.
goodnight89,I pay about $3 a week if they do the bare minimum (1 daily chore through out the week).
goodnight89,If they do any extra work I add a dollar here, a dollar there.
goodnight89,They have the option of going to Family Dollar and spending their money or they can save up.
goodnight89,Recently Snoochie got a dragon Lego set with her allowance and Bobo got a new video game.
goodnight89,As a kid, I can not remember a time when I was exempt from chores (except when I was physically injured or sick).
goodnight89,My mom had some grade “A” expectations too.
goodnight89,I had to brush 50 hair balls off of our dog.
goodnight89,Vacuum the living room.
goodnight89,Dust ALL the wood in the living room (and there was so much wood).
goodnight89,Of course I had to clean the playroom and my bedroom (those were my wrecking grounds anyway).
goodnight89,I had to help wash and fold laundry.
goodnight89,Clean, set, and clear the kitchen table.
goodnight89,Shovel the driveway and side walks on snowy days.
goodnight89,Rake the front, back, and two side yards when the autumn leaves fell, and mow the grass in the spring.
goodnight89,The more I think back, the more I can keep adding to this list.
goodnight89,When I was tiny my mom paid cut throat rates.
goodnight89,I got like 25 cents and a “Be lucky you got that.
goodnight89,I can make you do the chores for free if you complain.” She did get competitive with her rates though.
goodnight89,I remember loving Sunday’s because I’d get $5 if my chores were done on time.
goodnight89,After my parents separated my mom was incredibly busy between work and school.
goodnight89,She couldn’t stand a messy house, but wasn’t around to make sure it was cleaned and maintained.
goodnight89,That’s when I hit it big time.
goodnight89,That’s right ladies and gentlemen, at 14 years old I got a $25’s a week for helping my mom out.
goodnight89,If I had been a better kid, more altruistic, more sensitive, I would have refused the amount.
goodnight89,I didn’t though.
goodnight89,Unfortunately I was an insensitive kid.
goodnight89,I pocketed that money and loved every second of it.
goodnight89,My heft allowance got even more weighty.
goodnight89,My brother and sister also made a whopping $25 a week, but when they got real jobs they refused to help out.
goodnight89,My mom told me if I did their chores too, I could have their allowance.
goodnight89,I was pulling in $75 a week just by really thoroughly cleaning my house.
goodnight89,So when it comes to my kids, I feel weird burdening them with too many chores.
goodnight89,They each have a daily chore and then a few extra ones (like changing the trash, bringing in groceries).
goodnight89,I think we’ve got a good system.
goodnight89,
goodnight99,
goodnight99,(On a side note I have to work all night so this journal entry is a bit on the early side.
goodnight99,I know it looks like this is the second blog of the day, but it’s not since this website’s time is not in correlation with the time zone I live in).
goodnight99,Gluttony is another one of the 7 deadly sins.
goodnight99,It signifies over indulgence, lack of self righteousness and is often symbolized by a pig.
goodnight99,In the past gluttony played a role in my life.
goodnight99,It’s not that I always over eat... it’s that I’ve had past addictions that separated me from reality.
goodnight99,I over indulged to numb life and slip away from reality.
goodnight99,It took its toll on me as I didn’t give attention to the areas in my life that needed it most.
goodnight99,My past experience with gluttony is that during my pursuit to numb my mind I was withholding my attention to the areas of my life that needed it most.
goodnight99,These days gluttony and over indulgence doesn’t really play a part in my life.
goodnight99,I don’t drink nor do drugs.
goodnight99,I really over eat.
goodnight99,Most meals I can’t finish and end up sharing my left overs with Bobo or The Man.
goodnight99,If necessary I can go a couple of days without eating if that means ensuring every one else does get to eat (this situation isn’t applicable now, but it was during the darker days).
goodnight99,So my analysis from self examination is that gluttony is not one of the seven deadly sins that I am guilty of.
goodnight99,I’ll be ranking them as I write.
goodnight99,So here’s the list (1 being the sin I am most guilty of, 7 the least).
goodnight99,Vanity
goodnight99,Gluttony
goodnight99,
goodnight99,For next blog, I’ll discuss Sloth
goodnight99,
goodnight119,
goodnight119,Before I dive into the nitty gritty of this blog, I have a few things I want to say so you are very clear on how I feel.
goodnight119,The most important thing to note is that this entry is a rant, my opinion on RELIGION.
goodnight119,I will not try to talk you out of your beliefs nor will I debate mine.
goodnight119,Spirituality is a personal journey and whatever your beliefs might be, I respect that.
goodnight119,By no means ever will I cast judgement on a person based on what God they follow.
goodnight119,I am a human, like you.
goodnight119,It is not my place.
goodnight119,I guess that sums that up.
goodnight119,Onwards...
goodnight119,I was brought up in a strict Roman Catholic household.
goodnight119,We were in the pews every Sunday Mass.
goodnight119,We abstained from eating meat for lent.
goodnight119,I was baptized in the church.
goodnight119,I gave the readings at my first communion.
goodnight119,I went to confession and if I had nothing to confess, well I made stuff up.
goodnight119,I prayed to the Lord Almighty, Heavenly Father, Jesus, and of course holy Mary.
goodnight119,After I was confirmed, I never went to church again.
goodnight119,I never found comfort in my religion.
goodnight119,I had so many questions that were never wanted, approved of, or answered.
goodnight119,As a young adult I began to research as many religions as I could.
goodnight119,In the end, I’ve found my answers, my comfort, my source of balance.
goodnight119,Without taking you by the ankles and dragging you down the rabbit hole with me, I’ll say this: I’m pagan.
goodnight119,I believe in many gods and goddesses.
goodnight119,I do not “worship” them.
goodnight119,Instead my devotion is to the Earth.
goodnight119,I believe in ghosts, spirits, negative entities, and reincarnation.
goodnight119,I do not believe in a heaven nor hell.
goodnight119,I do believe that I have a moral obligation however and conduct myself appropriately.
goodnight119,I strongly do not believe that the bible is the word of god.
goodnight119,I do not believe a group of men have the right to cherry pick how I should live my life.
goodnight119,I hope I didn’t offend any of my readers.
goodnight119,If it works for you fantastic.
goodnight119,I however have many issues with Christianity and the bible.
goodnight119,I do not have issues with people who follow this faith however.
goodnight119,I respect you as a person and the beliefs you hold dear.
goodnight119,Me, categorizing myself as Pagan DOES not mean I pray to a false god or the devil.
goodnight119,I can not make my children learn a religion that I do not whole heartedly believe in.
goodnight119,For this reason they are  not baptised.
goodnight119,If they show an interest in a particular religion I encourage them to exam it.
goodnight119,I will never be the one to hold back faith.
goodnight119,Now having said all that (and feel free to ask any questions)... here is the rant.
goodnight119,Today it happened.
goodnight119,Deedee (who is Wiccan) came home from school and said that her teacher called Wiccan’s devil worshippers.
goodnight119,I was floored.
goodnight119,I was so tempted to call the school and give them the wrath of an angry mama lion.
goodnight119,Before I could give in to my anger, I knew I needed to calm down and objectify the situation.
goodnight119,I live in the bible belt.
goodnight119,How I choose to proceed with this could affect all 3 of my children for the rest of their public school career.
goodnight119,After asking a few co workers if any of the town’s high school teachers preached Christianity in the classroom, I learned that some do.
goodnight119,I can not blame someone for their commitment of their faith, but it angers me when they harshly judge something they hardly know anything about and misrepresent the facts – and to children no less.
goodnight119,My options here are limited.
goodnight119,If I make a big to do about this, I could be perceived as attacking a teacher who other than this is a really great teacher.
goodnight119,I won’t be in the middle of this feud.
goodnight119,My kids will be and they don’t want that.
goodnight119,They know fact from opinion.
goodnight119,I can use these incidents as lessons in tolerance instead.
goodnight119,I could pull them out of school or switch schools, but that won’t end things.
goodnight119,I need to make the best out of these difficult moments and demanding that religion be left out of school just isn’t going to fly here.
goodnight119,I’m in a rock and a hard place.
goodnight119,I’ve talked in depth with Deedee about it and she doesn’t want me to make a big to do out of it.
goodnight119,I know Deedee doesn’t worship the devil and Deedee knows it.
goodnight119,That should be what really matters.
goodnight119,The irony is that said teacher doesn’t know Deedee is Wiccan and constantly praises Deedee for being such a good student (who doesn’t get in trouble, who always completes assignments, studies for tests, and doesn’t talk out of turn).
goodnight119,This is one of those times I need to let it be, but for Deedee I’m wounded.
goodnight119,

goodnight84,
goodnight84,Ever since I was a child the “7 deadly sins” held my interest.
goodnight84,What I thought was intriguing is that they were never listed among the 10 commandments.
goodnight84,Although when exploring each deadly sin in depth it is easy to see how engaging in this behavior can lead to an immoral character.
goodnight84,I will write about each sin and how they affect my life.
goodnight84,I am starting with pride / vanity as currently I can see parallels between this sin and my view of myself.
goodnight84,Pride / Vanity is said to be the most vile, the most deadly sin out of the 7.
goodnight84,A perfect example of this sin is a self absorbed narcissist who demands constant validation and acceptance from others.
goodnight84,They seek compliments  and put themselves above others.
goodnight84,This is a form of self idolatry.
goodnight84,I think I can be a vain person when it comes to how demanding I am with how I look.
goodnight84,I obsess over my hair.
goodnight84,It’s always perfect.
goodnight84,I insist upon it.
goodnight84,I love make up.
goodnight84,I have quite a few dresser drawers devoted to my lotions, my lip sticks, eye pencils, hair brush, etc.
goodnight84,I don’t leave the house with out my tribal make up and my hair styled impeccably.
goodnight84,Certain nights of the week I sleep with a mixture of coconut oil and aragon oil massaged into my hair.
goodnight84,I wear a shower cap to protect my pillow cases.
goodnight84,15 minutes before I take a shower I lather honey all over my entire face and let it sit until I bath.
goodnight84,In my younger days (and I’m so sorry for my arrogance) I have actually had the nerve to say “If I ever get fat just shoot me” ... on multiple occasions.
goodnight84,How insensitive could I have been!
goodnight84,Karma has kicked in and now I have a pot belly.
goodnight84,So what do I do?
goodnight84,I’ve been fixated on dieting and exercising.
goodnight84,Could it be that I’m vain?
goodnight84,Humility is the opposite of vanity / pride.
goodnight84,I love to make other people feel good.
goodnight84,I love to give sincere, gooey, heartfelt compliments.
goodnight84,I place the value of myself above no one.
goodnight84,We as people are ALL equal.
goodnight84,I leave judgement up to higher powers.
goodnight84,I can be quite modest.
goodnight84,Although I am highly indulgent in a consuming grooming routine, if you were to compliment me I would shyly say thank you and blush.
goodnight84,I don’t like people gushing over me.
goodnight84,I give respect to those who have earned it and I give credit it where it is properly do.
goodnight84,So am vain?
goodnight84,Is there another sin I’m in deep with?
goodnight84,Next blog will be about gluttony.

goodnight104,
goodnight104,When The Man was a child his older brother got hit by a truck and tragically died.
goodnight104,The catastrophic event has forever haunted his family since.
goodnight104,I’m sorry, but I can’t go into private details that surround this unfortunate accident.
goodnight104,I wasn’t there, didn’t know the family back then, and I certainly didn’t know the boy.
goodnight104,While dating The Man our relationship grew ever more serious.
goodnight104,He met my family.
goodnight104,I met his.
goodnight104,He saw all my old family photos.
goodnight104,I saw his.
goodnight104,I told him all about the skeletons in my closet.
goodnight104,He dug up his old bones in turn for me.
goodnight104,So I learned in confidence all about *B* (The Man’s brother) and his untimely demise and how effected it left The Man ever after.
goodnight104,We had our first child, Deedee.
goodnight104,Life was great, but it became very clear to us that Deedee is a highly gifted child.
goodnight104,She grew too big too quick.
goodnight104,We knew we wanted a family with several kids so when Deedee was a month shy of 2, BoBo came into this world right on cue.
goodnight104,Bobo’s first moments outside of me were almost his last.
goodnight104,It was a complicated delivery and to this day, Bobo still deals with obstacles created by those first crucial hours.
goodnight104,Life with Bobo was chaotic, hectic, and tense.
goodnight104,He screamed and wailed for hours upon hours.
goodnight104,I knew he hurt and yet I couldn’t soothe him.
goodnight104,I felt like I was failing my infant son.
goodnight104,As he grew we did what most parents do, we documented his growth with picture after picture.
goodnight104,It was great memere who brought it to my attention at first.
goodnight104,BoBo acts and looks just like his dead uncle.
goodnight104,When pictures of the boys were put next to each other even I could not always tell which child was my beloved son.
goodnight104,Soon all the grandparents and extended family members were commenting how astonished they were by the extreme similarities.
goodnight104,“Well they should look alike”, I thought.
goodnight104,“They are from  the same bloodline”.
goodnight104,Bobo frequently had nightmares and night terrors.
goodnight104,He’d scream in his sleep as if his limbs were being torn from his body.
goodnight104,He’d choke on his tears and shriek at the top of his tiny lungs.
goodnight104,It was horrendous watching him go through this.
goodnight104,When he was around 3 years old, I was finally able to ask him about his nightmares.
goodnight104,What he told me shocked me.
goodnight104,He told me he was riding a toy down the street (a scooter, we were later able to identify it, but at 3 Bobo didn’t know what a scooter was).
goodnight104,He rode the toy down a hill when suddenly a big truck hit him and he died.
goodnight104,Again, I shall not go into graphic details, but Bobo accurately described how his uncle died... only thing was Bobo didn’t know anything about *B* and especially not his death.
goodnight104,One day I was driving through a town near where we lived.
goodnight104,I drove by a cemetery.
goodnight104,Bobo informed me as the car past by the headstones “that’s where my body is”.
goodnight104,I found out years later that the cemetery I had passed was the one *B* was buried in.
goodnight104,One day when Bobo was a toddler and my third child had just been born, we went to a picnic at a nature persevere.
goodnight104,It was a huge friend and family type event.
goodnight104,I sat at a table feeding my newborn baby (Snoochie) next to *J* (The Man’s cousin).
goodnight104,A lady I didn’t know sat down next to me (hoping to get to see the little cherub cradled in my arms).
goodnight104,She looked out at a field where The Man was playing kick ball with Deedee, Bobo, and a few other kids.
goodnight104,I watched as her face grew white and she clutched *J*’s arm.
goodnight104,“J” She gasped.
goodnight104,“Look at that little boy.” She pointed right at Bobo.
goodnight104,“I’m seeing a ghost, J. That’s little *B* + last name.
goodnight104,He’s dead though.
goodnight104,Do you see him?
goodnight104,There’s a ghost out there with those kids!” She was clearly shocked and freaked out.
goodnight104,I didn’t know who she was though.
goodnight104,Turns out she was a neighbor from when The Man and *B* were children.
goodnight104,J turned calmly to the lady and said.
goodnight104,“That’s no ghost.
goodnight104,That’s Bobo + last name, *B*’s nephew.
goodnight104,Look over there” he exclaimed pointing at The Man.
goodnight104,“That’s his dad, The Man”.
goodnight104,The lady had no clue I was Bobo’s mom.
goodnight104,I watched her relax and finally understand that she wasn’t seeing a ghost at all, just some very dominant DNA.
goodnight104,Some times Bobo knows things he shouldn’t.
goodnight104,Things about *B*.
goodnight104,Things there is no possible way he could know.
goodnight104,I’ve got to wonder if *B* was sent back for another chance at life.
goodnight104,A lot of the family finds it unsettling how uncanny the resemblance is between the two boys, but The Man doesn’t care.
goodnight104,He loves his brother even through the barrier of death and he loves the son he has now.
goodnight104,
goodnight138,
goodnight138,Dear Pb,
goodnight138,I miss you.
goodnight138,Remember all of the silly names I had for you, my bunny bumpkins.
goodnight138,I want you to know that I loved you dearly.
goodnight138,Memories of your buggy brown eyes will forever put a smile on my face.
goodnight138,I love the way you grunted and honked at the vacuum.
goodnight138,Your silly rabbit antics were endless.
goodnight138,I hated washing dishes, but to look down and see you at my feet made those darn dishes bare able.
goodnight138,Some people have teddy bears.
goodnight138,When I watched tv in bed I had you.
goodnight138,I’m sorry I couldn’t take you with me.
goodnight138,I wish with all my heart that I could brought you with us.
goodnight138,I feared such a huge move would have killed you.
goodnight138,Pb, you are a cure for the blues.
goodnight138,When I gave you to Crystal it’s because I knew she’d take good care of you.
goodnight138,What I didn’t foresee was that like I had once, she needed you.
goodnight138,I think of you from time to time.
goodnight138,I hope you still get chances to hop around outside and nibble yummy leaves.
goodnight138,I wish you were here, but I’m so glad that you give some one else all your bunny reasons to smile.
goodnight138,
goodnight116,
goodnight116,Can I tell you a little secret?
goodnight116,It’s one that’s nagged at me for most of my life, eating a way slowly at my conscious, my soul, and my self esteem.
goodnight116,Here it goes... I use to think I was evil.
goodnight116,Seriously.
goodnight116,I’m the girl with the bad vibe who your parents told you to stay clear of.
goodnight116,I most certainly don’t look evil.
goodnight116,I’m very petite with a thin, angular face, and cat like eyes that change color.
goodnight116,I have long slender arms with delicate, frail wrists.
goodnight116,Physically, I don’t look strong nor intimidating.
goodnight116,I will admit I’m one of those people who have facial expressions that always seem to range upon annoyance.
goodnight116,Those who know me know you really can’t judge my thoughts by face.
goodnight116,They don’t act in accord.
goodnight116,I most certainly don’t act evil although I must admit, I was a very rambunctious youth.
goodnight116,I have a limitless amount of energy.
goodnight116,I’m always moving and sometimes I just can’t seem to shut up.
goodnight116,I have a huge heart.
goodnight116,I always want to offer up good, sound advice or a positive solution.
goodnight116,I love to learn about people, make friends, compliment every pleasing thing I see.
goodnight116,I literally long to make other people happy and I expect nothing back in return.
goodnight116,That’s why in the past, I’ve had such a hard time with people.
goodnight116,Something about me draws them close.
goodnight116,Once I’m happy with this new found blossoming relationship something goes wrong.
goodnight116,My new buddy pulls away, withdraws like I am a cursed leper and I’m left wondering “What did I do?” “What did I say?” It use to really hurt me deep, but now I’ve learned to just let it be.
goodnight116,Move on, be myself, that’s all I can do.
goodnight116,I’ve never killed anyone.
goodnight116,Very few times do I think I was a bully.
goodnight116,I’m not violent.
goodnight116,I try not to lie, nor gossip, nor cause drama.
goodnight116,I don’t cheat.
goodnight116,I don’t steal.
goodnight116,I can pick apart my strengths and my weaknesses.
goodnight116,I never quite understood why people acted like I was a bad omen.
goodnight116,I may never know all the reasons for it.
goodnight116,The truth is I’ve learned a great lesson.
goodnight116,I have learned to rise above it and ignore it.
goodnight116,I can be no more than my true self.
goodnight116,Others are well within their personal rights to not like me even if it’s for no reason or one that makes no sense.
goodnight116,I won’t push back with the coldness they’ve given me.
goodnight116,I’ll keep a smile on my face and take stock of all that I am blessed with.
goodnight116,I won’t waste my energy holding grudges.
goodnight116,I’m not a resentful person.
goodnight116,I am light and like light, I bounce.
goodnight116,For many years I thought I was cursed, born evil, forever damned.
goodnight116,I tried not to let it hold me under because it was out of my realm of control.
goodnight116,Then one day I had an overwhelming epiphany.
goodnight116,Goodness is a choice.
goodnight116,Evil is a choice.
goodnight116,It’s not a condition that you are born with.
goodnight116,You are evil when you actively choose to be morally corrupt.
goodnight116,If I do not act in a vile manner how can I possibly be “simply” bad.
goodnight116,I can not.
goodnight116,I am not a victim of circumstance.
goodnight116,I have free will.
goodnight116,So you see, I was wrong to let people’s misjudgements weigh so heavily on my soul.
goodnight116,In the end their judgements can hold no candle to the love that is in my heart.
goodnight116,In fact, I feel sorry for them.
goodnight116,I give them my peace and love instead. 
goodnight116, 
goodnight116,
goodnight93,
goodnight93,I’m actually planning on blogging about an idea for a specific topic today, but before I dive into that subject matter I’d like to share an overview of my day so far.
goodnight93,Yesterday Snoochie picked me some wild flowers that have already started to bloom in our back yard.
goodnight93,Delicate white flowers with little green dashes at the tips of the petals and purple star shaped flowers now sit on my bed side table.
goodnight93,The aroma is intoxicating and reminds me of a floral perfume.
goodnight93,I’m not the only one in the house enjoying the sweet bouquet.
goodnight93,Jake, our kitten, keeps leaning in to inhale the fragrance.
goodnight93,This morning I awoke to the sound of hysterical screaming and crying.
goodnight93,Still half asleep, my heart pounded in my chest and a lump immediately swelled in my throat.
goodnight93,Did one of the cats die?
goodnight93,I quickly opened my bedroom door and realized the screaming was coming from my overly dramatic Snoochie.
goodnight93,She stole one of Bobo’s sneakers and was cruelly playing keep-a-way.
goodnight93,Aggravated, Bobo shoved his little sister on to the floor and took back his shoe.
goodnight93,The Man stepped in and separated them.
goodnight93,Really not a great way to wake up.
goodnight93,Today’s work out went fantastic!
goodnight93,I jogged at a steady pace for 20 minutes.
goodnight93,I read a few articles about how to effectively exercise and they mentioned using short, intense bursts of energy into a steady paced workout.
goodnight93,This is supposed to help speed up your metabolism.
goodnight93,So at every 5 minute interval I ran like a bat out of hell for 45 seconds.
goodnight93,After my jog, I did some basic steps.
goodnight93,My rhythm is improving.
goodnight93,At some point I’d like to make up a step routine of my own.
goodnight93,I did some strength training (alternating lunges and turbo twists).
goodnight93,Today I ended my routine with yoga instead of starting with it.
goodnight93,I must admit I am still a little sore, but not nearly as bad as I felt yesterday.
goodnight93,Once I started moving around, my legs and aching thighs gave no indication of the strenuous torture I’ve been putting them through these past few days.
goodnight93,I have a hunch that tomorrow these aches and pains will be even less of a nuisance to me than they were today.
goodnight93,I don’t have to work until 4pm tomorrow so I’ll be able to work out in the morning.
goodnight93,A few nights ago Deedee sat by my side while I was blogging.
goodnight93,She was very curious about all the different things I like to write about and read.
goodnight93,She confessed to having a blog of her own that remains entry-less because she never knows what to write about.
goodnight93,We discussed all the different choices for a topic she could use: her day, her dreams, her opinions, random stories, you can literally pull a topic out of a hat I explained.
goodnight93,So I too, have decided to write my thoughts on a seemingly random topic.
goodnight93,In fact I picked one topic so big that I can divide it into 7 different blogs.
goodnight93,The Seven Deadly Sins.
goodnight93,I think I’m going to tackle vanity first.
goodnight93,That’s what my next entry will be all about.
goodnight93,
goodnight108,
goodnight108,I haven’t written on update of daily life stuff in awhile because there hasn’t been too much going on.
goodnight108,The Man’s work schedule has changed and we’ve finally started adjusting to it.
goodnight108,He went from being a 3rd shift warrior to working 2nd shift.
goodnight108,Ugh.
goodnight108,It’s disappointing because now he isn’t home during the week day evenings and doesn’t get to see the kids very much.
goodnight108,He wakes up early to see them off before school.
goodnight108,He is more tired than usual.
goodnight108,I work some evenings as well, but I always manage to get home before the kids bedtime.
goodnight108,Deedee has been a huge help.
goodnight108,She never ceases to amaze and impress me.
goodnight108,It’s so important that she knows how much I truly appreciate her.
goodnight108,Deedee got nominated for a field trip.
goodnight108,She’s going to learn about S.T.E.M.
goodnight108,I hope she likes the program.
goodnight108,Deedee always looks into the future.
goodnight108,She has it all mapped out.
goodnight108,I wanted to say so much more about our week, but I must apologize.
goodnight108,I’m exhausted.
goodnight108,It’s going to be a very early night tonight. 
goodnight108,
goodnight132,
goodnight132,I am here for another day.
goodnight132,My soul dances underneath the moon, growing stronger from the stars.
goodnight132,I am such a fortunate, lucky woman.
goodnight132,I may not have everything I want and need, but I have everything one truly needs.
goodnight132,I have my health, I have my family, I have a warm dry roof over my head, and I have a full belly.
goodnight132,Bad days come and go.
goodnight132,They are fleeting like a thunderstorm.
goodnight132,I have used the pain and agony that I have truly suffered.
goodnight132,I used the torment to forge myself into something strong, quick, filled with hope and love.
goodnight132,I hope that I can be an example.
goodnight132,I hope I can be regarded as kind.
goodnight132,I hope my words will be heard as wise.
goodnight132,My soul is older than a time I can even imagine.
goodnight132,I do not know the full purpose of me rebirth.
goodnight132,Is it a gift or a punishment?
goodnight132,I suppose since as long as I live and breath, the reason doesn’t matter.
goodnight132,The important thing is that I am.
goodnight132,
goodnight111,
goodnight111,As a child and young adult, I never slowed down enough to realize the biggest pressing matter which would inevitably consume me whole.
goodnight111,I would be utterly powerless in its grasp.
goodnight111,Despite having relatives and even a good friend pass on it didn’t occur to me, that I too will one day be no more.
goodnight111,When my belly was swollen and full with unborn life getting ready to make its grand entrance, it hit me hard like a stone wall.
goodnight111,This life in me came from seemingly no where.
goodnight111,Sure, I know the scientific process and all that... but think about one moment I am me, next I am a creator.
goodnight111,As easily as my sweet babe can enter this world, her exit could be faster.
goodnight111,If she can go.
goodnight111,I can go.
goodnight111,Finally my mortality terrified me.
goodnight111,Awake in the night, I tried not to cry.
goodnight111,Crippling panic weld up inside me.
goodnight111,It took a few years, but I’ve made my peace.
goodnight111,I no longer worry about this absolute fact.
goodnight111,No matter what I do, I can not stop it.
goodnight111,So I go on.
goodnight111,I live my life.
goodnight111,I love my life.
goodnight111,It’s precious to me.
goodnight111,I take the time to value myself, my family, and everything that makes me smile.
goodnight111,It’s amazing and I will take the time to enjoy it until the very end.
goodnight111, 
goodnight111, 
goodnight111,
goodnight139,
goodnight139,The last time I saw snow falling down, I was running away.
goodnight139,I made the decision to get a fresh start in life.
goodnight139,This choice meant picking up my kids and moving, 1000 miles a way.
goodnight139,I have yet to regret it.
goodnight139,I needed clarity and to remove myself from seriously, negative people who caused so much drama that it seriously scarred my life.
goodnight139,The night I left it all behind snow and hail followed me through 3 states.
goodnight139,I spent time by the ocean.
goodnight139,I healed.
goodnight139,A bigger picture of what and how I want my life to be was revealed.
goodnight139,I finally figured out how to break free of the walls of my past.
goodnight139,This morning I was woken up by my phone ringing way too early for me.
goodnight139,Annoyed, I answered it.
goodnight139,An automated message told me that school all across the district was closed today.
goodnight139,I got out of bed, told the girls so they could sleep in, and I went back to sleep.
goodnight139,When I woke up again (at a normal hour), I peaked out the window.
goodnight139,It was raining.
goodnight139,Not a single snow flake on the ground.
goodnight139,I’m from New England.
goodnight139,If this is what the South calls a “snow day” ....
goodnight139,it’s kind of a joke, no offense.
goodnight139,I realize that South Carolina’s DPW probably doesn’t have the resources to deal with icy roads, snow accumulation, etc.
goodnight139,However, my kids were missing school on account of some cold rain.
goodnight139,Seriously?
goodnight139,I had to work at 4.
goodnight139,As I left the house Bobo and Snoochie were trying to make a snow man out of the first few falling flakes (keep in mind, by the time any of this snow actually started to stick the kids would have been home from school already).
goodnight139,Once at work a few people called out and one guy never showed up.
goodnight139,We were dead for awhile, but as the night wore on business picked up since we were the ONLY place open.
goodnight139,Eventually we got the call to close early.
goodnight139,Patrons were seriously aggravated and annoyed with us.
goodnight139,By the time I left work my car was encased in a sheet of ice.
goodnight139,It took 15 minutes for my windows to be defrosted enough for me to be able to drive.
goodnight139,I made it down the street, stopped for a red light, and felt the breaks lock up, and the car slid.
goodnight139,I drove with care the rest of the ride home and it was uneventful other than passing by other cars on the road that were literally crawling at 15 mph and sliding everywhere.
goodnight139,Some one needs to teach these southerners how to properly BRAKE in icy conditions.
goodnight139,South Carolina doesn’t have any requirements regarding safety inspections for vehicles on the road.
goodnight139,This means that the road ways are filled with cars that really aren’t all that safe and are driving right next to you.
goodnight139,I imagine there’s a large amount of cars that have tires with seriously bad tread – no wonder why they freak out about driving in snow or ice – their cars aren’t safe to begin with.
goodnight139,shm...
goodnight139,I won’t lie though, it’s nice to see the snow, only if it’s a micro inch coating.
goodnight139,It reminds me of all the bullshit I left behind and reinforces that I am on the right track!
goodnight139,ps the attempted snow man build was a total flop
goodnight139,ps the picture is of Deedee, back in New England, taken during what we thought to be one of the last snow falls we’d see in a very long while,
goodnight139,
goodnight85,
goodnight85,In moments of depression, anxiety, uncertainty I grasp on to the same M.O.
goodnight85,I need to change something, make it different, make it my own.
goodnight85,I’ve gone through several dozens different hair colors, piercings, and of course I’ve got a few tattoos.
goodnight85,I’ve given up most of the piercings.
goodnight85,These days I rock 2 simple ear piercings and I am content with that.
goodnight85,I have a scar on the edge of my right ear brow from an old bar bell.
goodnight85,Don’t plan on ever re-piercing it again.
goodnight85,It’s the same with my navel.
goodnight85,I got it pierced when I was 18.
goodnight85,I took the ring out when I got pregnant.
goodnight85,Don’t really care to show off my tummy anymore.
goodnight85,I have daughters that look to me for guidance.
goodnight85,Tonight I’m sitting on a sheet in my living room with color stripper in my hair.
goodnight85,I’m done with my red locks.
goodnight85,Time for something new.
goodnight85,My plan is to go as blond as possible.
goodnight85,I’m nervous and tentative.
goodnight85,I know from past experience it is really difficult to dye red hair blond.
goodnight85,So I’m using color oops and crossing my fingers.
goodnight85,Oh man do I hope I don’t wind up with Ronald McDonald orange hair.
goodnight85,It’s happened to me once before.
goodnight85,When Deedee was about 2 years old I attempted to dye my hair to be as golden blond as hers.
goodnight85,It was a miserable, epic failure.
goodnight85,I was horrified by the shocking orange color.
goodnight85,I re-dyed it something darker to fix it and that was that.
goodnight85,I’ve never tried to dye my thick locks blond again.
goodnight85,The irony is, I was born blond.
goodnight85,I’ve also used supposedly temporary black dye on my hair for a special occasion.
goodnight85,HUGE mistake.
goodnight85,I had to grow the hair out that was way too dark for my complexion.
goodnight85,It took about 2 years.
goodnight85,Since my two dyeing catastrophes I’ve played it safe and stuck to reds and browns ever since.
goodnight85,I’m tired of looking the same way.
goodnight85,I live in a new state, have a new job, slowly changing my wardrobe.
goodnight85,I’d like a new hair color to go along with it.
goodnight85,I’ve got enough tattoos and piercings anyways.
goodnight85,
goodnight142,
goodnight142,I am an awakened, spirituality conscious individual.
goodnight142,I am aware that my energy connects to every every other life force on this planet.
goodnight142,It is all connected.
goodnight142,We are all connect and tapped into the very core of the Earth.
goodnight142,The elements are a key source of power.
goodnight142,Intention is a stronger force of will than one might expect.
goodnight142,The key to life is simple.
goodnight142,Live your life.
goodnight142,Live it the way you want too.
goodnight142,I interpret that to mean enjoy each day that I have life.
goodnight142,Live to the fullest.
goodnight142,Both sentiments are not always possible.
goodnight142,I’d rather make the most of each day which various bumps and obstacles included.
goodnight142,Love yourself.
goodnight142,Your life is for you so give it meaningful value.
goodnight142,Sure, you can love others too.
goodnight142,But you can not truly love anyone else until you love yourself for all that you AND all that you are not.
goodnight142,Make peace with the fact that you are not perfect.
goodnight142,No one is, so we must learn out short comings are perfectly acceptable.
goodnight142,Embrace your flaws.
goodnight142,I find it a good philosophy to strive to be perfect and accept what is actuality.
goodnight142,In the thick of all your relationships, do not have expectations.
goodnight142,Always act with that logic in your mind.
goodnight142,If you work hard, give selflessly in the hopes of receiving praise, acknowledgement, or anything in return you will be disappointed.
goodnight142,Act for yourself instead.
goodnight142,Everything else will fall into place.
goodnight142,If you are in a negative mind set you should change your thinking.
goodnight142,The only thing you have true control over in this world is yourself.
goodnight142,Think and act with this in mind.
goodnight142,The human mind is amazing and we only use a small percentage of it.
goodnight142,Awaken and the possibilities will become endless.
goodnight142,Remember the 7 chakras.
goodnight142,Open them all.
goodnight142,Work to undo the blocks.
goodnight142,In a future blog I will go deeper into this.
goodnight142,Have a beautiful day.
goodnight142,Love yourself.
goodnight142,Love the world around you.
goodnight142,
goodnight136,
goodnight136,It’s not if often that I say this...
goodnight136,But I am aggravated, irritated, frustrated, and annoyed.
goodnight136,Can’t wait to go to sleep and be done with today... only problem is, I’m an insomiac.
goodnight136,Every one else is the house is soundly sleeping except for me.
goodnight136,I swear the corners of my eyes are twitching.
goodnight136,It isn’t a big deal, I swear.
goodnight136,6 hour shift under big boss in a mediocre mood.
goodnight136,He makes no sense.
goodnight136,He has no rhyme or reason.
goodnight136,He lacks people skills.
goodnight136,I’m sure there is plenty he is good at.
goodnight136,He expected me to snatch a utensil out of his hand tonight because it was what I NEEDED to get food out (a spatula to get burgers off the grill).
goodnight136,Instead I took some wax paper, wrapped it around the spatula I shouldn’t use (cross contaminated) and finished my work.
goodnight136,I was smug with satisfaction.
goodnight136,Great problem solving skills, Inanna.
goodnight136,Yeah... not so much.
goodnight136,Big boss tells me next time to just grab it from him.
goodnight136,Say what?
goodnight136,Are we in preschool squabbling over who gets a turn with the big blocks?
goodnight136,I made it through.
goodnight136,Its only 6 hours and it’s a paycheck.
goodnight136,I get home and the man is drunk.
goodnight136,Wouldn’t have been so bad if he didn’t keep playing too rough with the kids, got me rounded up to drive him to the store to get smokes only to decide that all the good stores are probably closed.
goodnight136,Yup, I felt like I was in preschool all day today... only with adults.  
goodnight136, 
goodnight136,
goodnight90,
goodnight90,How often these days can I sit back, reflect, and think “life is good”?
goodnight90,Frequently.
goodnight90,The funny thing is I mean it.
goodnight90,My life is great.
goodnight90,No, I am not famous (not that I want to be anyways).
goodnight90,No, I’m not rich (not big into material stuff anyways).
goodnight90,I have everything I need though.
goodnight90,Today was especially great.
goodnight90,Yes, I’m not into material things all that much, but sometimes a shopping trip is fun.
goodnight90,I can’t deny it.
goodnight90,The Man took me to the mall today and let me go nuts.
goodnight90,Literally, I could get what ever I want.
goodnight90,I secretly suspect there was no set limit on today’s free for all because The Man knows I can’t stand wasting money.
goodnight90,He knew I’d get a few new outfits maybe a pair of shoes and that’d be it.
goodnight90,He was right.
goodnight90,I love my new clothes!!!
goodnight90,And my new sneakers are so freaking comfortable.
goodnight90,I had to wear my work sneakers all the time because my $8 pair of “what are those” family dollar wannbe converse were pretty much so ripped they were talking.
goodnight90,I have a sneaker fetish.
goodnight90,I love those sporty shoes.
goodnight90,I especially love big, puffy boy high types.
goodnight90,I love Air Jordans... like walking on a cloud.
goodnight90,I also really like Osiris’s, but they are a little hard to come by in the South.
goodnight90,I have really small feet so I can either get woman’s sneakers (bleh... so NOT me) or I can fit into boy’s sizes.
goodnight90,Yup.
goodnight90,I buy kids shoes.
goodnight90,I have to admit, The Man telling me today was only about me really felt nice deep inside.
goodnight90,I kept trying to get clothes he needs too, but he said not today.
goodnight90,He even carried every single bag around the mall.
goodnight90,Chivalry is not dead ladies!
goodnight90,So today I’m a spoiled brat.
goodnight90,It’s okay for just one day... right?
goodnight90, 
goodnight90,
goodnight118,
goodnight118,Some times I like to look back through my old journal entries.
goodnight118,It’s fun to revisit my past and reminisce.
goodnight118,So this entry is an update of what life is like in my house right now, what interests I have, and so on.
goodnight118,Just to warn anyone reading, I’m probably going to babble quite a bit.
goodnight118,Today is cold, but not as cold as it would be if I still lived up North
goodnight118,Today my favorite song is “Crossroads” by Avenge Sevenfold
goodnight118,Recently I got the kid’s progress reports.
goodnight118,Out of the three, Snoochie got the highest marks although the other 2 received approving marks as well.
goodnight118,I’m proud of all 3.
goodnight118,I burned my arm at work tonight.
goodnight118,It’s stinging me even as I type.
goodnight118,I just finished Vikings seasons 1 – 3.
goodnight118,I can’t wait for the next season to come out!
goodnight118,My favorite character is Floki and the trend has been for The Man and me to mimic him.
goodnight118,Yesterday was the Super bowl and the Broncos won.
goodnight118,I could care less.
goodnight118,I’m addicting to Cooking Fever (it’s a game).
goodnight118,I intend to download World Chef next.
goodnight118,I’ve fallen of the horse, so to speak.
goodnight118,My diet has been terrible lately.
goodnight118,I need a kick in the pants.
goodnight118,Toothless and Jake are bff’s today.
goodnight118,It’s super cute.
goodnight118,Could it be possible that she’s finally warming up to the kittens?
goodnight118,The Man bought me a huge heart shaped box full of delectable chocolates.
goodnight118,I’m in love.
goodnight118,I’m planning on dyeing my hair.
goodnight118,I want to go blond.
goodnight118,I think that’s probably enough to say for tonight
goodnight118, 
goodnight118,
goodnight83,
goodnight83,It’s just behind my eyes
goodnight83,The power to control you
goodnight83,Such a little effort
goodnight83,To have you wrapped around my fingers
goodnight83,Your beating heart is in my hands
goodnight83,I could squeeze the life right out of you
goodnight83,Turn you into my broken toy
goodnight83,Come play with the succubus
goodnight83,I’ll take every thing you’ve got
goodnight83,And you’ll still come back to me
goodnight83,I’m your obsession 
goodnight83,I’m your addiction
goodnight83,With one small look
goodnight83,I’ll leave you mesmerized 
goodnight83,You’re drawn in before you know
goodnight83,It’s too late for you to run away
goodnight83,I’ll infest your mind like a disease
goodnight83,I’ll find you in your dreams
goodnight83,Kneel before me in submission
goodnight83,Cause I’ll do as I please
goodnight83,I warned you before I got started
goodnight83,And now, you’re mine
goodnight83,You belong to me
goodnight83, 
goodnight83,
goodnight95,
goodnight95,My sunshine, rainbows, and kittens is slowly dissolving leaving mush in  my mouth and rocks in my stomach.
goodnight95,I know life will always have its ups and downs, meetings and partings, but sometimes good byes are too difficult to bear.
goodnight95,Last night, I let myself and my natural tendencies to get the better of me.
goodnight95,The result?
goodnight95,I took my unfounded suspicions, paranoia, and anxieties out on the man.
goodnight95,I feel terrible for this.
goodnight95,I’m grateful that he’s so kind hearted and understanding that he can see past this.
goodnight95,Maybe that’s because of the dark cloud from today.
goodnight95,We took one of our cats to the vet today.
goodnight95,The vet came highly recommended.
goodnight95,My sweet princess Toothless is on the decline, but she’s only 4 years old.
goodnight95,Her rear end is so tiny.
goodnight95,She’s lost so much weight.
goodnight95,Her coat is dull.
goodnight95,Her hind legs are so weak.
goodnight95,I’m watching her rot and mystified as to the cause.
goodnight95,I’ve been trying to eliminate the more obvious problems, but as to what’s going on with her, I only had suspicions.
goodnight95,Could be her kidneys.
goodnight95,Could be hyperthyroidism.
goodnight95,Could be allergies.
goodnight95,Could be cancer.
goodnight95,Guess what?
goodnight95,It’s cancer.
goodnight95,She has a tumor in her spine.
goodnight95,It’s bone cancer.
goodnight95,It’s inoperative.
goodnight95,No surgery can fix this.
goodnight95,Chemo isn’t an option.
goodnight95,She’s on borrowed time.
goodnight95,I fought my tears as I saw the X Ray of Toothless’s disintegrating spine.
goodnight95,Soon she will be paralyzed and we will have to put her down.
goodnight95,There is no miracle coming to save the day.
goodnight95,Only my tears.
goodnight95,I was sent home with pain medication to keep her comfortable.
goodnight95,I was sent home with no hope.
goodnight95,I have my love for her still though.
goodnight95,I have this final time to spend with her.
goodnight95,She’s still my sweet girl.
goodnight95,She still purrs and wants to be pet.
goodnight95,She still places her soft, velvet paws in the palm of my hand.
goodnight95,She still nips my fingers.
goodnight95,I still have time with her for at least a little while.
goodnight95,My kids will be coming home from school soon and I’ll have to face them with the truth.
goodnight95,I know she’s just a cat, but she’s so much more to us.
goodnight95,She’s a member of our family.
goodnight95,She’s softened our moments of pain.
goodnight95,She’s been that needed hug.
goodnight95,She’s been our shoulder to cry on.
goodnight95,She’s that giggle of sheer joy.
goodnight95,Now it’s our turn to care for her like she cares for us.
goodnight95,I can only hope that in these final days she knows she is loved.
goodnight95, 
goodnight95,
goodnight122,
goodnight122,Jacob Mark Pitts has a gleam in his eyes.
goodnight122,He prowls lightly on his feet with the fluid movements of an instinctual predator.
goodnight122,If he was larger, he wouldn’t think twice about killing you.
goodnight122,He sleeps up high above the fridge or on top of my wired shelf.
goodnight122,He’s obsessed with running water (and no, he is not diabetic).
goodnight122,He runs into the bathroom and sings at full volume.
goodnight122,“Meeeeer-ooooW-Kkkk”.
goodnight122,He loves to pronounce “Ka” sounds.
goodnight122,He’ll tell you a story if you ask.
goodnight122,He’s been known to break into bathroom and join us when we take showers.
goodnight122,It’s just too hilarious to make a more concentrated effort to kick him out.
goodnight122,He does not have the ferocious appetite his brother (Andrew Dennis Beirsack) has.
goodnight122,Jake cares very little when I shake his bag of treats.
goodnight122,It’s not enough to entice him to appear.
goodnight122,Andy, on the other hand, hears the treat drawer slide open from 2 rooms away.
goodnight122,Jake is very healthy compared to his brother.
goodnight122,Born into a litter of 5, Jacob was the runt.
goodnight122,He was chosen because of his slight, slender frame and for the markings on his forehead.
goodnight122,He is black, but his paws are white and he has 3 patches of white fur from his neck to his belly.
goodnight122,I made the mistake of switching his food to a different brand when the kittens were about 18 weeks old.
goodnight122,The store near my house doesn’t carry the brand I use.
goodnight122,Within 4 days of using the cheaper, more common brand, I watched in agony as Andy’s health sharply declined.
goodnight122,He was lethargic, he couldn’t get up to eat or drink.
goodnight122,His breathing grew rapid and shallow.
goodnight122,Jake saw his brother get sicker and sicker.
goodnight122,Jake abandoned his dieing brother.
goodnight122,I used a combination of TLC, science, and magick to save Andy.
goodnight122,I threw out what I suspected was tainted food.
goodnight122,I hand fed him.
goodnight122,I saged him.
goodnight122,I gave him a white light of my energy.
goodnight122,Andy survived, but because of his illness, Jake “the runt” was bigger than his brother.
goodnight122,Andy has fully recovered.
goodnight122,He’s happy and playful.
goodnight122,Jacob enjoys a sense of power now that he is as big as his brother.
goodnight122,When I get home from work Jake and Andy greet me at the door.
goodnight122,They make me smile.
goodnight122,There is something therapeutic in petting a cat. 
goodnight122,
goodnight147,
goodnight147,I hate being a flake.
goodnight147,The list of things I want to accomplish is massive.
goodnight147,What I ACTUALLY manage to do is fairly meager.
goodnight147,For example my adhd can run rampant if I’m not actively attempting to keep it in check.
goodnight147,Most of the time I can... unless I’m around another high energy person.
goodnight147,So far at the new job I’ve managed to stay on task and focus... tonight however, I got distracted.
goodnight147,Its my own damn fault.
goodnight147,I’m well aware of my tendencies.
goodnight147,It just sucks to have to actively shut my crazy switch off so I can function like a semi-normal human.
goodnight147,Oh but there’s medication I can take for it!
goodnight147,Thanks, but no thanks.
goodnight147,I’d rather reach deep inside of me to train myself to concentrate, alleviate pain, and so on.
goodnight147,I don’t like taking pills to solve a problem.
goodnight147,To me, that is the essence of dependency.
goodnight147,My plan was to get my emt training and pass the certification exams.
goodnight147,I really feel this field of work would be the best way for me to utilize my body as well as my mind.
goodnight147,Orginally the plan was for me to concentrate on this alone.
goodnight147,Did it happen?
goodnight147,Am I signed up for a single course?
goodnight147,No.
goodnight147,I’m not.
goodnight147,I do have a new job though and income.
goodnight147,Its not like I’ve been idle with me time.
goodnight147,I do need to buckle down though and speak to the admissions department so I can at least be on the right path.
goodnight147,In parting I’ll say this: The new year is almost here.
goodnight147,2016 will be dedicated towards furthering my future: body, mind, and soul.
goodnight147,I’m getting depressed thinking about my future crack down on soda.
goodnight147,Good bye Mountain Dew.
goodnight147,I’ll miss you.
goodnight147,
goodnight106,
goodnight106,The winds howled fiercely today.
goodnight106,Broken tree limbs sailed past my window.
goodnight106,The house shook.
goodnight106,It would seem as if the Ides of March have come in early this year, in like a lion out like a lamb.
goodnight106,Yesterday night Snoochie did the dishes (it’s her assigned chore).
goodnight106,The seal on one of the pipes couldn’t hold up and the kitchen flooded.
goodnight106,How lovely... I kept my calm through this mild disaster.
goodnight106,Sometimes I like to embrace the chaos life throws at me.
goodnight106,Snoochie helped me clear out the cabinets below the sink and mop up all the gross standing water.
goodnight106,This morning my handyman, The Man fixed the sink.
goodnight106,Life goes on.
goodnight106,After ranting about my weight and spring time goals in my blog yesterday, I fired up the yee ole wii fit.
goodnight106,I’ve gained ten pounds since last year.
goodnight106,Oh crap.
goodnight106,It may not seem like a lot, but trust me, it is.
goodnight106,I’ve always been that awkward skinny girl who could cram anything I wanted down my throat and never gain an ounce.
goodnight106,I’ve actually had people seriously accuse me of being anorexic before and they’ve tried to stage an intervention.
goodnight106,Their false assumptions amused me.
goodnight106,I eat like a total pig... in fact, my diet was total crap back in my skeletor days.
goodnight106,Add that to the fact that I don’t routinely exercise and I never have.
goodnight106,Yes, I am energetic and yes, I am always in motion... but you’d never see me running miles around town.
goodnight106,What I had was a fast metabolism.
goodnight106,Now that I’ve actually gained and held on to some weight, I am facing the fact that my metabolism has slowed down.
goodnight106,I’m aging.
goodnight106,These are the facts that I must face.
goodnight106,The kids had a blast watching me run on the wii, do step aerobics, and tried out some yoga.
goodnight106,After just two days of a 30 minute work out my thighs are aching!
goodnight106,I will not let this deter me and secretly I love the burning pain.
goodnight106,It’s a sign of my hard work.
goodnight106,If I’m sore tomorrow I plan on sucking it up, take some Aleve, and stay true to my regiment.
goodnight106,All I have to do is lose 10 pounds.
goodnight106,I am realistically giving myself 2 months to accomplish this.
goodnight106,I know I’ve got what it takes.
goodnight106,The Man was in a mood this morning.
goodnight106,I thought about it on the dark drive home from work tonight.
goodnight106,We’re experiencing a minor drift.
goodnight106,He is so important to me.
goodnight106,I choose him.
goodnight106,I love him.
goodnight106,I’d like to take some of his stress and frustration a way.
goodnight106,I need to leave in an hour to go pick him up from work.
goodnight106,He didn’t sleep good last night hence his grumpy cat exterior today.
goodnight106,My plan is to give him a nice back rub before he falls asleep.
goodnight106,I’m not a very outwardly affectionate person and sometimes I forget how important physical human contact can be to others.
goodnight106,You see, as an empath who ever touches me (or vice versa) causes me to feel their emotions.
goodnight106,It can be an overwhelming , over stimulating experience.
goodnight106,It’s not always pleasant.
goodnight106,You can not hide your true self from me.
goodnight106,When I have physical contact with other people it’s as intimate as them being naked in front of me.
goodnight106,With The Man it doesn’t matter.
goodnight106,We have nothing to hide from each other.
goodnight106,I had made a habit of avoiding contact so unfortunately I neglect the ones I love, like The Man.
goodnight106,He’s too bashful and grown-up to seek me out for hugs like my sweet babies do.
goodnight106,The wind is still roaring.
goodnight106,I can hear the snap of branches as a type.
goodnight106,I can hear debris flutter along the road.
goodnight106,Toothless (my kitty) is sleeping soundly in her bed next to mine.
goodnight106,Andy and Jake are chirping out in the hallway.
goodnight106,I really love my life. 
goodnight106,
goodnight101,
goodnight101,A year ago I could barely stand the sight of him... or myself.
goodnight101,He represented all those demons stirring inside me that I desperately wanted to cast into exile.
goodnight101,Every day we were trapped in the same, numb routine.
goodnight101,I tried so hard to put my foot down.
goodnight101,I really did.
goodnight101,Too bad I was utterly failing myself, my dreams, and my convictions.
goodnight101,As the snow flew in a furious white blanket, blinding our eyes and freezing our exposed skin a different kind of storm raged through my mind.
goodnight101,I love you, but this is too much.
goodnight101,You are my destruction.
goodnight101,I can never get better in this toxic stew.
goodnight101,Temperatures dropped.
goodnight101,Glass shattered.
goodnight101,So did my heart.
goodnight101,The moment had been forced by his hand, not mine.
goodnight101,I did what I had to do.
goodnight101,I did it to save my own life.
goodnight101,It was by far the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make.
goodnight101,I didn’t even get the chance to say goodbye.
goodnight101,There was nothing to fall back on.
goodnight101,I was on my own.
goodnight101,No more could I invoke his name in my own self destruction.
goodnight101,There was no one, but me.
goodnight101,It was lonely at the bottom, but at least I could only rise.
goodnight101,Surely I had sunk down as far as I could go.
goodnight101,Months went by and I realized just how much I missed him.
goodnight101,It’s funny how the sun still shines even when you’re dieing on the inside.
goodnight101,He’s always had my heart.
goodnight101,Without him it didn’t beat quite the same any more.
goodnight101,I couldn’t go on with the ghost of my past.
goodnight101,Only eagerly inch forward and with increasing momentum I grew strong.
goodnight101,Eventually we had to speak and we did.
goodnight101,It was tense those first few times.
goodnight101,We couldn’t even hold a conversation without ripping each other to pieces.
goodnight101,That’s when I realized how much I’d hurt him and it was every bit as sour as he had made me feel.
goodnight101,Pain the great equalizer, like birth, and like death.
goodnight101,Neither of us can take back the past.
goodnight101,Baby steps became steady.
goodnight101,I heard happiness and pride in his voice.
goodnight101,Whether or not we would every be together again no longer mattered.
goodnight101,We BOTH deserve happiness.
goodnight101,I realized if we did want to try again, it’d have to be a whole new relationship.
goodnight101,I could never bring up anything from the past to hold against him.
goodnight101,More importantly I needed to forgive him.
goodnight101,Forgiveness, giving it was a rush.
goodnight101,A huge weight lifted off me.
goodnight101,I wouldn’t want every mistake I make or flaw I have recited to me over and over... so why hadn’t I held him to the same standard.
goodnight101,So when is too much enough... when you are no longer yourself.
goodnight101,When your future is at stake.
goodnight101,When you are being physically hurt.
goodnight101,When is it not enough?
goodnight101,When you are fortunate enough to have that rare partner who is willing to work with you every step of the way to climb from hell to heaven. 
goodnight101,
goodnight143,
goodnight143,Some people are “cat” people.
goodnight143,Some people are “dog” people.
goodnight143,There are even people who aren’t big on pets altogether or maybe they are content with some colorful fish.
goodnight143,Different strokes for different folks.
goodnight143,Me, I’ve always been a dog person.
goodnight143,Its how I was brought up (not too mention my mum is terribly allergic to cats so they were never a real option).
goodnight143,I grew up close in age to the family dog so much so that he was more like a sibling than pet.
goodnight143,Losing him was like losing a brother.
goodnight143,Hands down he was the most loyal and intelligent animal I’ve ever had the privilege of knowing.
goodnight143,Dogs require a lot of money, time, attention, and space.
goodnight143,I miss not having a dog, but my situation doesn’t seem fair to thrust a dog into.
goodnight143,In my house, we have cats.
goodnight143,Jake and Andy, my idiotic kittens are a serious dose of cuteness and therapy.
goodnight143,I love their independent streaks.
goodnight143,Originally I planned to take just one of them in, but something about the way they are instantly made me realize I couldn’t separate them.
goodnight143,They are best friends as well as brothers.
goodnight143,Andy was the mama’s boy of the liter.
goodnight143,He could easily be a fat cat.
goodnight143,He loves to fetch his toy mouse, kinda like a dog.
goodnight143,He’s fiercely protective over his food and his little brother.
goodnight143,The markings on his face give his expression a comical quality.
goodnight143,We call it derpy.
goodnight143,Jake was the runt.
goodnight143,His streamline shape and graceful movements remind me of a tiger on the hunt.
goodnight143,He’s vocal and loves the sound of his own voice.
goodnight143,Sometimes he sounds like a pigeon.
goodnight143,He loves to rub his head against mine. 
goodnight143,
goodnight117,
goodnight117,Today was the big day.
goodnight117,The girls were so excited.
goodnight117,Ladies Day with grandma included a trip to the hair dresser (which in this household is an extremely rare indulgence).
goodnight117,Snoochie had been counting down the days since last week.
goodnight117,I have a long, awkward history when it comes to going to a professional to get my hair done.
goodnight117,It never ever comes out the way I wanted it.
goodnight117,On top of that, they always “discover” my curls and I end up leaving feeling like a mortified poodle.
goodnight117,I paid money to have my precious hair violated.
goodnight117,There’s only been one hair dresser in my life who cut, styled, and dyed my hair the way I liked it.
goodnight117,That’s it.
goodnight117,Out of a legion of scissor holding trained stylists just the one was up to snuff.
goodnight117,The worst ever experience was when I was about 10 years old.
goodnight117,We were just about done and as I peaked in the mirror I was digging my cute pixie bob.
goodnight117,Suddenly the hair dresser buzzed the back of my head with clippers.
goodnight117,Oh no!!!
goodnight117,She actually gave me a duck’s ass.
goodnight117,I couldn’t face going to school the next day.
goodnight117,The front of my head looked amazing, but in the back... oh my!
goodnight117,To this day I cringe when I hear electric clippers buzzing maniacally.
goodnight117,When I was a teenager I stopped going to hair salons.
goodnight117,Long locks are pretty too after all.
goodnight117,When necessary I cut and dyed my own hair.
goodnight117,I was satisfied with the results and if I screwed up, I only had myself to blame.
goodnight117,Sometimes I’d find that rare gem of a friend who’d cut my hair for me and honestly, they always did a better job than the professionals.
goodnight117,In their younger years I cut my kid’s hair myself.
goodnight117,Deedee had straight blond so I’d just trim it and give her some bangs.
goodnight117,Snoochie is a different matter.
goodnight117,She has wild, crazy curly hair.
goodnight117,No matter what I did with it, her hair just bounces back into a mass of wild tangles.
goodnight117,One time I gave Snoochie bangs.
goodnight117,It was a huge mistake.
goodnight117,Lesson learned the hard way.
goodnight117,Nowadays I try to straighten her hair as much as possible.
goodnight117,As for Deedee, she cuts her hair herself.
goodnight117,She dyes it herself.
goodnight117,So far she’s had pretty good luck as far as her hair is concerned.
goodnight117,She lives for manic panic.
goodnight117,The girl’s special day ended later than anticipated.
goodnight117,A little after 10 pm the girls were dropped off.
goodnight117,Snoochie now rocks a soft bob and now has blond high lights!
goodnight117,It’s so cute.
goodnight117,Some one tamed Snoochie’s angry hair.
goodnight117,Deedee... on the other hand....
goodnight117,her hair has been hacked.
goodnight117,Her hair is way too short, uneven, and her bangs stick out.
goodnight117,She’s miserable.
goodnight117,She’s home from school today and keeps bursting into tears.
goodnight117,It’s obvious the poor hair dresser has little to no experience with emo hair cuts (especially choppy layers) and my sweet Deedee is paying the price.
goodnight117,So now I’m looking at wigs, extensions, or for a hair dresser with a little more experience.
goodnight117,I hope we can compromise and find something for her.
goodnight117,I can’t leave her like this.
goodnight117,Edited to add: The Man and I took Emily to another hair salon today.
goodnight117,The hair dresser (Helena) made a miracle out of a terrible hair cut.
goodnight117,It’s super short and styled into a striking emo do and more importantly, Deedee absolutely loves it.
goodnight117,So step-grandma spends $80 on a cut and Deedee hates it.
goodnight117,Dad spends $15 on a hair cut and Deedee feels like a rock star! 
goodnight117,
goodnight140,
goodnight140,There’s this huge news story going on right now... a two year old boy is missing.
goodnight140,Most likely he’s in some deep woods in Tennessee.
goodnight140,He slipped away from his grandma and no one has seen him since.
goodnight140,He disappeared a week ago.
goodnight140,I can’t help but get sucked up into the story like it’s a vortex.
goodnight140,I found myself frequently checking for updates as the days, hours, minutes go by.
goodnight140,My attention was, is drawn in deep.
goodnight140,I read the stories and comments.
goodnight140,I never gave my opinion on anything even though theories play out in my mind.
goodnight140,My emotions tug and pull.
goodnight140,The horror of a lost, cold, small child eats at my heart.
goodnight140,Then there was this afternoon...
goodnight140,3:10 pm and the school bus hadn’t rolled up yet.
goodnight140,By 3:15 pm I’ve got the creeps.
goodnight140,No intuition kicking into over drive yet, but my mind started to race.
goodnight140,3:20 pm Snoochie’s bus should have stopped at the house by now.
goodnight140,I’m trying to remember what Snoochie wore to school today.
goodnight140,My description would be “A girl with bright blew eyes, a leopard spotted jacket in blue tones, and crazy, curly brown hair”.
goodnight140,3:25 And I decide if she doesn’t come home by the time Bobo’s and Deedee’s bus drops them off I am officially beginning the frantic search.
goodnight140,The first 24 hours are crucial!
goodnight140,At 3:30 the school bus stops in front of the house.
goodnight140,Deedee and Bobo saunter in the house at their usual arrival time.
goodnight140,Snoochie was 20 minutes late.
goodnight140,Her bus driver forgot to stop at the house before he went to the middle school to reload the bus with more homeward bound students.
goodnight140,She was home though.
goodnight140,That’s what matters.
goodnight140,I can squish her with hugs.
goodnight140,I can kiss her cheeks til they’re red.
goodnight140,I can tell her “I love you” one more time.
goodnight140,I am the luckiest woman alive.
goodnight140,I have my baby.
goodnight140,She’s safe.
goodnight140,Last night was really cold, below freezing.
goodnight140,I turned the heat up so they kids would sleep comfortably.
goodnight140,I curled my blanket tightly around me.
goodnight140,I don’t see how a 2 year old in a long sleeved shirt and jeans can survive this frigid cold air.
goodnight140,Today it hailed and snowed for a short while.
goodnight140,I don’t see any chance of survival for a boy lost in the woods in this weather.
goodnight140,My heart aches.
goodnight140,I don’t know Noah Chamberlin, but I’m terrified for him.
goodnight140,Has his parents begun to give up hope?
goodnight140,Do they stay faithful and without doubt that they’ll see their little boy again.
goodnight140,I’m sorry for what they are going through.
goodnight140,I never want to be in their shoes.
goodnight140,One huge comfort I will have tonight is that my fabulous trio is safe and sound with me tonight.
goodnight140,I will remember how easily and quickly things can go wrong.
goodnight140,I will use this as a stark, fresh reminder that it is always time to live in the moment and cherish life and love with all of my heart.
goodnight140,I shall never take a hug for granted.
goodnight140,Update: Today they found the little boy.
goodnight140,Unfortunately, it was too late.
goodnight140,The past few days have been a mix of wet and cold... I didn’t think it would be possible for the lil’ guy to make it through this with some sort of miracle or divine intervention and sadly, I was right.
goodnight140,My personal opinion on the matter: He died Tuesday night.
goodnight140,He had no jacket, no hat, no food, and no water.
goodnight140,I think he was a fighter though.
goodnight140,I think he managed to survive the first couple of days, but exhaustion took its toll.
goodnight140,Yet again I will go to bed tonight thankful my babies are safe and sound under my roof.
goodnight140, 
goodnight140,
goodnight87,
goodnight87,It started from the moment Deedee could put crayon to paper.
goodnight87,She delighted in drawing all the splendour of her world.
goodnight87,After coating my fridge in her 18 month old drawings, I made a startlingly revelation.
goodnight87,Deedee always drew people and animals with a secondary outside outline.
goodnight87,She’d shade the areas in between her subject with a very specific color code.
goodnight87,Whenever she drew a picture of me, sure enough there’d be this brownish green outline around my figure.
goodnight87,When she was older, I was able to get to the bottom of this mystery.
goodnight87,Deedee sees auras.
goodnight87,If she were to look at you, she’d see colored lights emitting from all around you.
goodnight87,Every person has their own specific color.
goodnight87,Upon my initial awakening, I did not see in terms of what Deedee sees.
goodnight87,I could see a light around living beings with maybe a tinge of color, most tinged towards gold or blue.
goodnight87,What Deedee sees so deeply is the energy that you are made of.
goodnight87,You emit a color scheme of light all around you, whether you see it or not.
goodnight87,Now, I see it too, but not as spectacular as Deedee sees it.
goodnight87,It’s not as defined.
goodnight87,Did you know dear reader that when you write I FEEL how you feel, not what you say and from afar I can pick up traces of your aura.
goodnight87,What’s in your heart is no secret to me.
goodnight87,While you write cryptic poetry or write a short paragraph about your day... I, Ianna see the depths of your very soul.
goodnight87,You’ve been warned.
goodnight87,However, fear not.
goodnight87,Tis not my place to speak on your behalf.
goodnight87,You be you and I’ll be me.
goodnight87,Whaa O, Amber is the color or energy
goodnight87,Oh and incase you were wondering, mine is green with a very golden yellow light.
goodnight87,
goodnight103,
goodnight103,Once the sun fades over the horizon, after the sky shines pink and purple, my moon rises up high to greet me.
goodnight103,It’s light is pale and hollow.
goodnight103,It doesn’t warm you up.
goodnight103,Still it is the spot light that casts its beam encasing me in light.
goodnight103,Unlike the sun, the moon is delicate.
goodnight103,Without the star’s companionship the moon would look forlorn in its solitude.
goodnight103,The irony is the sun is a star and yet when it takes the time to face us, it is the only star we see.
goodnight103,Under a crescent moon, I feel alive.
goodnight103,Summer nights spent swimming in black water, sitting in front of a crackling fire, lying down on a fleece blanket making order of the cosmos, these are the things I like to do.
goodnight103,Today I had a thought.
goodnight103,We, people, are like flames.
goodnight103,People who do not dwell on the bad have lights that shine oh so bright.
goodnight103,As for others their flame may sputter or flicker.
goodnight103,They may long to be stamped out.
goodnight103,As a flame can light another flame, we should use this as example.
goodnight103,People need to be filled with light.
goodnight103,Some one who is depressed needs it so much more.
goodnight103,Take the time to share it with them so that we may all be light.
goodnight103,Relationships seem so hard when they end.
goodnight103,People nurse their broken hearts.
goodnight103,Take heed and comfort in my words.
goodnight103,Wrap them aroundyour shoulders like a blanket.
goodnight103,Life is a series of meetings and partings.
goodnight103,When love leaves us, realize yes it hurts and yes it is real, but the future will bring you something better.
goodnight103, 
goodnight103,
goodnight97,
goodnight97,I have a filthy potty mouth that makes truck drives blush.
goodnight97,I think there’s something striking about a teeny lil’ thing like me when I open up my wee lil’ mouth and the cuss words just pour out like steam.
goodnight97,I like to be shocking.
goodnight97,I won the battle of swears when I was 12.
goodnight97,My parents separated and my dad moved out.
goodnight97,My mom, over powered by her 3 teenage kids just couldn’t seem to stop us from swearing.
goodnight97,My parents never swear.
goodnight97,I’ve heard my mom cuss once, exactly once.
goodnight97,Dinner would go “Hey bro, pass the fucking salt”.
goodnight97,His reply “Here you go you little cunt.” To which my mom would say “You guys are awful.” We’d just laugh and laugh.
goodnight97,Swears lose their meaning when they become adjectives and verbs.
goodnight97,After a certain point of hear “you’re so cute... until you open your mouth” you learn you are growing up.
goodnight97,Maybe it’s time to talk like one.
goodnight97,There’s this list of truly forbidden swears I just can’t bear to utter.
goodnight97,The #1.
goodnight97,No no word, the “N” word.
goodnight97,So derogatory I just can’t say it.
goodnight97,Not ever.
goodnight97,#2.
goodnight97,GD and #3.
goodnight97,JC.
goodnight97,It’s a respect thing.
goodnight97,#4.
goodnight97,Retard.
goodnight97,I hate this word with a passion.
goodnight97,Don’t mock the mentally challenged.
goodnight97,Not cool.
goodnight97,#5.
goodnight97,Fag.
goodnight97,Don’t mock gays.
goodnight97,Not cool.
goodnight97,Up North, nobody says the “n” word.
goodnight97,Nobody.
goodnight97,That word has fallen off the face of the planet.
goodnight97,Doesn’t matter if you’re white or black.
goodnight97,No one uses it.
goodnight97,Down here I hear black people say it all the time.
goodnight97,I know I probably have no right to say or think this, but it bugs me, people constantly saying the “n” word.
goodnight97,They think it’s funny.
goodnight97,I personally feel it’s disrespectful.
goodnight97,For all those people who fight racism and discrimination, hearing this word all day at work it’s a slap in the face.
goodnight97,That’s right.
goodnight97,I’m half white, half Hispanic and the “n” word really bothers me.
goodnight97,I stopped swearing so much when I had my kids.
goodnight97,Didn’t need for them to go off into the world with trash talk and toilet mouths.
goodnight97,Monkey see, monkey do.
goodnight97,So wouldn’t constant use of the “n” word keep it in circulation even with non blacks who have “no right” to say it?
goodnight97,I know it’s weird but it bugs me
goodnight97,
goodnight124,
goodnight124,Although I have a great number of opinions on the hot topics sweeping across the country, I usually keep my personal thoughts to myself.
goodnight124,When online or dealing with other people, I try to follow this method:
goodnight124,           T – is it true?
goodnight124,H – is it helpful?
goodnight124,I  – is it inspiring?
goodnight124,N – is it necessary?
goodnight124,K – is it kind?
goodnight124,When reviewing my mental check list if it appears not to follow within these guidelines, I try to stay tight lipped with my useless opinion.
goodnight124,I find that I avoid a lot petty arguments this way and don’t waste my energy on those who can’t see past their own egos.
goodnight124,Unfortunately, I feel as if a great amount of today’s society has lost site of humanity, compassion, and respect for each other.
goodnight124,We have grown into a large population of narcissists.
goodnight124,Of course this isn’t the case for every individual out there.
goodnight124,However all too often I see large scale examples of mob mentality.
goodnight124,We must learn not to be swayed as simple minded sheep.
goodnight124,As I mentioned in a previous post, I’ve been closely following the case of 2 year old Noah Chamberlin who ran away from his grandmother and sister during a nature walk on a warm January afternoon.
goodnight124,After an exhausting week long search, Noah was found, deceased.
goodnight124,There were many cold, wet nights and it’s very conceivable the poor child expired from exposure and hypothermia.
goodnight124,What made this news story particularly fascinating to me was the overwhelming amount of volunteers, search dogs, and technology used in a desperate attempt to find the boy.
goodnight124,All methods failed.
goodnight124,However, the area police refused to acknowledge that maybe there was more that meets the eye and that this could possible be anything more than an “accident”.
goodnight124,The police claim Noah’s family would never harm him and that they were a good, Christian family.
goodnight124,I went into my critical thinking mode... the statements made about this family irked me in so many ways.
goodnight124,Seriously?
goodnight124,Are Christians found to be impossible of committing crimes?
goodnight124,Inflicting child abuse?
goodnight124,Committing murder?
goodnight124,Is Christianity a defense used to prove some one innocent?
goodnight124,What if Noah was a black child?
goodnight124,Would the police still be persisting the family’s uninvolvement of the child’s disappearance?
goodnight124,Would the search still have been massive?
goodnight124,I honestly don’t think it would have been the same if Noah wasn’t white.
goodnight124,I’m sorry to state this and raise this point, but I truly feel the police would have been pointing fingers if Noah came from a black family, or a mexican family, etc.
goodnight124,I think race and religion has EVERYTHING to do with it.
goodnight124,White parents have harmed their children.
goodnight124,Christian parents have harmed their child.
goodnight124,Examples of child abuse, murder, and the like have been found in EVERY ethnic group, religion, economic status, across the globe.
goodnight124,No one categorized group is exempt.
goodnight124,Please realize, I’m not saying this family is guilty of lying to police to cover anything up.
goodnight124,I don’t know them.
goodnight124,I haven’t met them.
goodnight124,I was never a part of this nor am I an expert on the matter.
goodnight124,In fact, if anything I feel sorrow and pity for the family.
goodnight124,If this tragedy happened accidentally as stated, than I can only imagine the pain and heaviness in their hearts.
goodnight124,I hope that one day the wounds won’t sting so much.
goodnight124,I hope the agony doesn’t tear an innocent family apart.
goodnight124,Who am I to question their story?
goodnight124,I’m no one really.
goodnight124,I am simply an individual who doesn’t approve of some one using religion to proclaim innocence.
goodnight124,Maybe it’s because I am not a Christian that this bothers me so much and rubs me the wrong way.
goodnight124,I just don’t see how skin color, religion, and like makes one exempt from committing crimes against humanity or disregarding the welfare of another being.
goodnight124,Does me being Pagan mean that I would be scrutinized and judged to be guilty if I faced a similar crisis?
goodnight124,Would people assume because I’m pagan I must be capable of harming the very children I love and care for?
goodnight124,We live in a world with so much senseless violence.
goodnight124,A waitress was shot and killed at work because she asked a patron not to smoke in the establishment.
goodnight124,A good samaritan was shot and killed trying to help a man who’s car had gotten stuck in the snow.
goodnight124,Terrorist groups strike to kill as many people as possible.
goodnight124,Life is precious and so many twisted individuals take it upon themselves to end the live’s of others.
goodnight124,When we live in a world without peace, it’s hard to know just who is innocent and who is guilty.

goodnight98,Inanna
goodnight98,“Inanna is the Queen of Heaven and Earth”
goodnight98,Inanna is a Mesopotamian / Sumerian deity, a goddess.
goodnight98,She is one of the first Earthly Anunnaki offspring.
goodnight98,Some associate her with Istar or Isis, but neither of those figure heads are the reincarnation of Inanna.
goodnight98,Inanna is not a daughter of Adam.
goodnight98,She was a very passionate woman, although she always retained a youthful appearance.
goodnight98,She had a very complex, dynamic personality that ranged from sensuous lover to fierce warrior.
goodnight98,In ancient portrayals of her, she is pulled by lions on a chariot.
goodnight98,While many of the ancient deities earned the title “Mother Goddess”, Inanna did not although she was referred to as “Morning Star”.
goodnight98,She is also closely associated with resurrection and reincarnation for she was able to travel to the Underworld and than back to Earth.
goodnight98,It’s a fascinating, ancient myth.
goodnight98,In fact, mentions of Inanna go as far back to some of the first ever recorded word.
goodnight98,Inanna was powerful as well as lustful.
goodnight98,She conquered knowledge, reincarnation, amongst other sought powers.
goodnight98,She was a lover as well as a warrior and renowned for both qualities equally.

goodnight145,In the United States it is Thanksgiving today.
goodnight145,Even though I’m American this just isn’t one of my favorite holidays.
goodnight145,I hate squash and I’m not big on turkey either.
goodnight145,While I do appreciate the sentiment of taking a day or a moment to reflect upon what I am thankful for before a long cold winter sets in, I feel one should gratefully list these assets at the end of each and everyday for each day that we live is truly a gift.
goodnight145,The concept behind the first Thanksgiving is so removed from this modern age.
goodnight145,To me, celebrating it in a way that customs dictate seems to be hypocritical and condescending.
goodnight145,It would be one thing if the early Americans didn’t abuse and kill the Native Americans or if their culture and beliefs hadn’t been obliterated, but that is the true history between these cultures.
goodnight145,So celebrating Thanksgiving and ignoring the history seems like an ignorant joke to me.
goodnight145,I know people mean well, but maybe we should pick a different day for this type of celebration.
goodnight145,In this day and age Thanksgiving symbolizes the start of the count down to Christmas.
goodnight145,Its all to commercialized for my taste.
goodnight145,Having been brought up Roman Catholic I celebrate Christmas because it is expected and my kids enjoy participating in all the holiday events.
goodnight145,I feel like a traitor turning my back on my personal beliefs just to go with flow.
goodnight145,I think this is the year I will turn my back on Christmas and celebrate an older holiday instead.
goodnight145,C’mon Yule!
goodnight145,
goodnight129,
goodnight129,I miss the fellowship... it’s hard to explain and if you’re actually reading this I apologize.
goodnight129,It’s probably not something you’d be able to understand.
goodnight129,It’s just me giving into what most of society would assume to be a delusion.
goodnight129,I can try to explain the madness and the insanity, but at the end you’d just doubt me and that is something my heart can not take right now.
goodnight129,The easiest thing for me to be honest about is this – I’m an empath.
goodnight129,That means that I experience the feelings of others through a connective process (speech, touch, close relationships, etc.).
goodnight129,I feel their feelings as if they are my own.
goodnight129,I can not distinguish what is actually me or some one else.
goodnight129,Others near me might see me burst into tears or giggle which can occur at highly inappropriate times.
goodnight129,It happens when some one connected with me experiences a very powerful emotion.
goodnight129,On the day of the Paris terror attacks I was very unsettled.
goodnight129,I keep telling the man no one has the right to end someone else’s life.
goodnight129,I didn’t know what kept making me say that.
goodnight129,It didn’t pertain to anything going on in my life and yet I was scared, sad, and angry.
goodnight129,I found out that night about the attacks and when I calculated the time zone difference it was exactly when I had my “anxiety” attack.
goodnight129,My mood can effect the mood of others with no verbal or physical output.
goodnight129,My emotions leak into the air.
goodnight129,If I had a bad day at work everyone experiences my tension when I walk in my front door even if I don’t reflect my mood.
goodnight129,For the good and well being of those I love, it’s imperative that I always stay positive.
goodnight129,Sometimes people “hear” my thoughts.
goodnight129,They know the exact phrase I’ll think in my head even if I said nothing in reality.
goodnight129,I really despise this phenomenon.
goodnight129,My thoughts should be just for me especially if I never intended to vocally utter them.
goodnight129,I could go on and on about my peculiar quirks.
goodnight129,I use to belong to an online community connecting me to people like me.
goodnight129,There ended up being too much drama so I dropped it like a bad habit.
goodnight129,Days like today make me wish that I hadn’t.
goodnight129,I miss feeling like a drop in the oddball ocean.
goodnight129,In my isolation I feel like I stick out like a sore thumb.
goodnight129,I’m forced to keep this part of me hidden for fear of violent scrutiny.
goodnight129, 
goodnight129,
goodnight80,
goodnight80,I’m counting down the days.
goodnight80,Counting out of excitement.
goodnight80,Counting out of misery.
goodnight80,It’s disconcerting to be counting both for good and for bad.
goodnight80,Toothless has about a month left.
goodnight80,That’s just a guess based off of her veterinarian’s prognosis and from what I’ve read about spinal lymphoma on the internet.
goodnight80,In reality there is no expiration date.
goodnight80,In fact, I feel horrible inside for I’m the one calling the shots.
goodnight80,When the tumor eats away at her spinal cord and her hind legs are paralyzed, that’s our “sign” to euthanize.
goodnight80,Pretty shitty if you ask me.
goodnight80,Then there’s Tyrion.
goodnight80,Originally we were going to name him Ben, but not everyone in my house liked that name.
goodnight80,Why Tyrion?
goodnight80,In my house we are Game Of Thrones fans.
goodnight80,My favorite character is Tyrion.
goodnight80,I love his logic.
goodnight80,I love that even though he’s a Lannister, he’s got morals.
goodnight80,He has compassion.
goodnight80,In all honesty, I suspect him of being Tygaryen.
goodnight80,In the books he’s depicted of having one green eye and one purple eye – a Tygaryen trait.
goodnight80,Popular fan theory is that his mother was raped by the Mad King.
goodnight80,So I’m naming my kitten Tyrion.
goodnight80,He’s about 3 weeks now.
goodnight80,I have about 3 – 5 more weeks before I can bring him home.
goodnight80,I love his golden color and his little stripes.
goodnight80,Toothless is completely black.
goodnight80,Jake is almost all black.
goodnight80,Andy is black and white.
goodnight80,This kitten will help heal our hearts over sweet Toothless.
goodnight80,He’s not a replacement.
goodnight80,We were intending on having 4 cats.
goodnight80,From what I hear little Tyrion is a loud mouth.
goodnight80,I like vocal cats.
goodnight80,He’s just starting to walk.
goodnight80,Soon he will be home and running around playing with his big brothers.
goodnight80,
goodnight148,
goodnight148,I am a believer and user of pscionics.
goodnight148,In other words I am psychic to an extent.
goodnight148,My strongest talent is as an empath.
goodnight148,In other words, I connect and physically feel the emotions of people around me and people who I am strongly connected too.
goodnight148,I can see auras, not strongly though.
goodnight148,I wasn’t always able to see them.
goodnight148,This “trick” or talent came as I learned how to pull the energy force from others to me.
goodnight148,In a way, this is a form of physic vampirism... and while some may feel there is no such thing, let me just say it’s real.
goodnight148,One would be wise to take caution when dealing with such a person.
goodnight148,Your energy field is their food.
goodnight148,I effect the dreams of others.
goodnight148,These dreams feel entirely real to the dreamer.
goodnight148,Sometimes I think it was a manner of energy feeding, other times I realize it has a far deeper meaning: my inner soul shed bare longing to connect.
goodnight148,I’ve predicted the future.
goodnight148,Not when I wanted to, not when it counts.
goodnight148,I’ve never prevented a tragedy and I’ve never won the lottery.
goodnight148,Precognition isn’t something that I can call on at will, but it has happened.
goodnight148,I can communicate with others like me from a distance within my mind.
goodnight148,Its thrilling to actually call or talk to these people later and see that they did in fact,  share this experience.
goodnight148,I’m not much of a medium.
goodnight148,I can NOT talk to ghosts / spirits and RARELY do I see them.
goodnight148,I can however feel their energy and I can feel their emotions... it’s a very overwhelming experience.
goodnight148,There is no place for me in the bible.
goodnight148,By my very nature (creative,  independent, seeking truth)  I admit, I follow a left hand path.
goodnight148,God has no place for me.
goodnight148,I do not dwell on it.
goodnight148,My soul is immortal.
goodnight148,I have lived, died, and been reborn many many times.
goodnight148,I am a flawed, simple human – the same as you.
goodnight148,At one time life time and life times ago I was Inanna... which may have been something then, is now utterly insignificant.
goodnight148,I live each day in the hope to be great again.
goodnight148,After all, its not about the lives I have lived, it is about the here and now.
goodnight148,
goodnight110,
goodnight110,It’s getting late (for me anyways).
goodnight110,For once I’m sort of stumped on what to write.
goodnight110,Usually I can always think of some thing.
goodnight110,I feel an idea for a topic beginning to shake up in my mind.
goodnight110,I’m dyslexic.
goodnight110,If you’ve read my journal before you might have noticed a few grammatical errors.
goodnight110,Yeah, I’m the chick who can’t always type a coherent sentence, but in my head I do!
goodnight110,I also have a strong bad habit of leaving words out or substituting the wrong word for a word I had really meant to say.
goodnight110,If I focus really hard I can correct myself, but more often than not my brain just sees what it wants to see and I won’t notice my grammar breech at all.
goodnight110,I have a high iq despite my set back.
goodnight110,My level of “disability” is mainly effected when it comes to output I give (writing and speech) and not at all with input.
goodnight110,I can speed read.
goodnight110,I’ll read from the top of a page to the bottom with a quick diagonal nod of my head.
goodnight110,It’s extremely important to me to stay as sharp as possible.
goodnight110,I love to write.
goodnight110,I have notebooks upon notebooks with free flow poems and short stories I’ve never successfully managed to finish.
goodnight110,Reading is a way of life for me.
goodnight110,Reading inspires me.
goodnight110,Library trips in my household occur weekly.
goodnight110,We don’t have cable.
goodnight110,I’m proud to say that all 3 of my babies are book worms, especially Bobo.
goodnight110,The Man is the most avid, dedicated reader.
goodnight110,He’s always in the middle of a book.
goodnight110,I mix up numbers.
goodnight110,It’s easier for me to read a group of numbers and recite them than it does for me to repeat back a random grouping in sequential order.
goodnight110,I need a surgeons level of care and attention when I’m making a financial transaction.
goodnight110,In my head I know it, but something goes haywire when I need it to apply.
goodnight110,Don’t ask me for directions.
goodnight110,I have trouble with the concept of left and right.
goodnight110,It disorients me for some reason I can’t fathom.
goodnight110,The big irony is that I understand north, west, east and south perfectly.
goodnight110,I am no stranger to a map.
goodnight110,I never get lost, ever, even when I try to.
goodnight110,I have a very accurate internal compass.
goodnight110,In my head east, south, north, and west are 2 D while left and right are 3 D and make my head spin.
goodnight110,I want to write more about this, but I’m getting pretty sleepy... good night
goodnight110,
goodnight123,
goodnight123,The girls had a sleep over with their grandpa this week.
goodnight123,Deedee came back with a new pair of boots.
goodnight123,It might not seem like it at first glance, but Deedee is sort of spoiled.
goodnight123,I’m not complaining that she gets extra time at her grandparent’s house, or that they take her out for almost every meal, or even that they buy her nice things.
goodnight123,It’s just that when it comes to Deedee one cannot help, but give her a monster or a chocolate treat.
goodnight123,I can easily say no to Snoochie and Bobo, but resisting Deedee isn’t so easy.
goodnight123,While we were enjoying time with just Bobo we took him to El Pablano.
goodnight123,The three of us had a great time.
goodnight123,I also treasure those moments when I can give 100% of my attention and affection to just one of the three.
goodnight123,Bobo, the man, and me had a great time going out for dinner (despite the fact we couldn’t have our giant punch bowl margaritas since Bobo was with us).
goodnight123,I binge watched a show call Vikings this week end.
goodnight123,I love this show.
goodnight123,It’s epic.
goodnight123,The fact that the Vikings were Pagan, believe in signs and psychics, and are brutal pillaging warriors totally enthralled me.
goodnight123,The man’s bloodline comes from the Scottish highlands and I swear he has ancient Viking blood in him (we thought this for years, long before this show came along).
goodnight123,I worked a lot this weekend (but I did get to enjoy Saturday off).
goodnight123,Friday night we closed early because of the snow storm, so unfortunately I lost an hour.
goodnight123,Yesterday was my long shift.
goodnight123,My next day off is Thursday, which seems so far away.
goodnight123,I’ve been more focused at work.
goodnight123,I’m paying sharp attention to all those little details.
goodnight123,I like being able to hold my own.
goodnight123,The Man took me shopping for new pants.
goodnight123,It’s kind of bitter sweet.
goodnight123,Yes, I need new clothes.
goodnight123,I squeeze into pants that are way too small.
goodnight123,I hate the shape it gives me.
goodnight123,Muffin top.
goodnight123,Gross.
goodnight123,I have to admit, I loved being so teensy that my daughters’ pants were too big for me.
goodnight123,Now I’ve been forced to borrow them just so I can fit comfortably into something.
goodnight123,I may never get my old size back, but I’m not giving up.
goodnight123,Yes, I’m not fat, but I am not satisfied with my shape and tone.
goodnight123,It’s been too cold to walk outside so following my “diet” is going to be crucial for the last few winter months.
goodnight123,
goodnight81,
goodnight81,If I ran into you, I’d try not to look at you.
goodnight81,I’d just keep going about my business and give you that glare of mine that makes you feel like I’m looking right through you.
goodnight81,It’s not that you aren’t worth my time of day.
goodnight81,Simply put... I’ve moved on.
goodnight81,Bet you didn’t expect that out of me?
goodnight81,Honestly what’s the point of even thinking about you and me?
goodnight81,There’s literally nothing there.
goodnight81,You were just the first one to know it.
goodnight81,All you were and are to me, is ideal, an addiction, a fixation.
goodnight81,I guess it took everything out of me to realize that the person I thought I could love forever was done.
goodnight81,I get it.
goodnight81,I suck.
goodnight81,I was wrong.
goodnight81,No room in you for forgiveness.
goodnight81,My worst error of all, was that I couldn’t let you go.
goodnight81,Sorry for thinking the world of you.
goodnight81,Shoulda known better, but I was young.
goodnight81,Funny thing is I use to imagine bumping into you again.
goodnight81,Let you see how different I am.
goodnight81,Play coy.
goodnight81,Little dirty girl all grown up.
goodnight81,Fantasy is futile and I’ve no time for your ghost.
goodnight81,So goodbye.
goodnight81,Let your name crumble into the wind.
goodnight81,I hope I never see you again.
goodnight81,No hard feelings, my first love.
goodnight81,I’m in a good place and I don’t like complications.
goodnight81,I’m done testing people to the brink of their devotion.
goodnight81,I have something pure, something unconditional, something better than you.
goodnight81,
goodnight126,
goodnight126,It’s time I buckle down and remember the distinct separation of church and state.
goodnight126,Well, in my case it is more of a matter personal life verse work relationships.
goodnight126,A comment flew off the tongue of a co-worker, a highly inappropriate comment.
goodnight126,I suppose I should divulge its content, but I’m reluctant.
goodnight126,I’ve spent 24 hours going back and forth between stewing over it and actively ignoring it.
goodnight126,Everyone will judge so the only judgement that holds water is my own.
goodnight126,However, I’d rather not have rumors fly around about me and my name dragged through the mud.
goodnight126,This is, after all, a huge reason I chose to move so far a way in order to give myself a fresh start.
goodnight126,So in this case the proper course of action is to be a busy bee, keep to myself, and hold my tongue.
goodnight126,Certainly there is no need in this instance for confrontation or retaliation.
goodnight126,To move past this I must hold my head high and show my worth.
goodnight126,Respect is earned.
goodnight126,Time for me to buckle down, ignore personal slights, work hard, and speak with love for others.
goodnight126,Positivity can and shall be contagious.
goodnight126,#keepingitstraight 
goodnight126,On the home front... I’ve caught The Man’s cold.
goodnight126,Yuck.
goodnight126,At least I have an excuse to be lazy for a day or two.
goodnight126,
goodnight131,
goodnight131,I’ve never actually sat down and wrote my own bucket list.
goodnight131,Sure, I dream big.
goodnight131,There’s places I want to travel to, things I want to have.
goodnight131,So here it goes.
goodnight131,My bucket list.
goodnight131,1.)
goodnight131,I want a paranormal tour of the Earth.
goodnight131,Here in the states I especially want to go to New Orleans, Waverly Hills, The outer island’s of South Carolina, The Cecil hotel, and Myrtle’s plantation.
goodnight131,Sites out of the states would include poveglia (plague island), Pompeii, Venice (in general), Leap Castle (and other structures involved with the Hellfire Club – so Ireland), Hoia Baciu Forest in Romania (specifically, the clearing), and southern Iraq due to it being where it was once known as Sumeria & Mesopotamia.
goodnight131,Shame that’s now a really conflicted area and I might never be able to see it.
goodnight131,2.
goodnight131,Family Vacation to Hawaii, cuz why not!
goodnight131,On said vacation I’d love to hike up some volcanoes, not to mention I’d love to surf.
goodnight131,3.
goodnight131,Own my own house with my own garden.
goodnight131,Before I die, I’d love to be as self substantial as humanly possible.
goodnight131,Move off the grid for awhile.
goodnight131,4.
goodnight131,Fix the botched tattoo on my ankle.
goodnight131,It needs a cover up badly.
goodnight131,5.
goodnight131,Hike the Appalachian Mountains for a summer.
goodnight131,6.
goodnight131,Own a jet ski
goodnight131,7.
goodnight131,Get one of my books or stories published
goodnight131,8.

goodnight131,9.
goodnight131,Kick my nail biting habit.
goodnight131,Seriously.

goodnight131,Renew my wedding vows.
goodnight131,I didn’t plan much of my wedding and I’d really love to redo it and make it a more thoughtful and personal event
goodnight131,11.
goodnight131,Breed rabbits.
goodnight131,I love me some bunnies!
goodnight131,12.
goodnight131,Start my own restaurant with Snoochie.
goodnight131,It’s our big dream
goodnight131,13.
goodnight131,Go back to college and GRADUATE 
goodnight131,I guess that is it for now
goodnight131,
goodnight134,
goodnight134,I grew up in an old, big, red house.
goodnight134,It had been my home since the minute my parents brought me home from the hospital.
goodnight134,The horse hair plastered walls and wooden beams hold the precious memories of my infancy.
goodnight134,My mother would sit in her rocking chair and nurse me.
goodnight134,I’m getting to old to comprehend just how those earlier years went.
goodnight134,I imagine baths in the kitchen sink, sleeping soundly in the nursery, my mom pacing around trying to sooth a swaddled infant me.
goodnight134,I grew up knowing there was more to the house than what meets the eye.
goodnight134,I always sensed that not only was something not quite right, but even when I was alone, I wasn’t REALLY alone.
goodnight134,Certain spots in the house chilled me to the bone.
goodnight134,One spot that particularly scared me was the landing on the stair well between the 1st and 2nd floor.
goodnight134,I never walked up and down those stairs.
goodnight134,I always ran up them, jumped down them, or slid down the banister.
goodnight134,Those stairs stirred a feeling of sheer terror in me.
goodnight134,They felt sinister.
goodnight134,Everyone has got a ghost story about my old house.
goodnight134,I have a whole life time’s worth that I could easily write a novel dedicated to the paranormal activity that occurred within those walls.
goodnight134,Some stories scared the daylight out of me.
goodnight134,Some make me go “hmmm”, but one story in particular simply brings a smile to my face.
goodnight134,My sister use to tell me that a ghost lived in her bedroom.
goodnight134,“It’s an old lady,” she’d tell me.
goodnight134,“She sits in mom’s old rocking chair by the window.
goodnight134,She’s a nice old lady ghost.
goodnight134,She protects me from the bad ghosts.” I believed my sister.
goodnight134,I never, ever, not once SAW the old lady, but I could certainly feel her.
goodnight134,Her essence was sad, but protective.
goodnight134,Sometimes I had friends over.
goodnight134,After they’d return from using the second floor bath (which was 2 rooms a way from my sister’s bedroom) they’d remark to me: “I didn’t know your grandmother lives with you.” Wait... what?
goodnight134,Neither of my grandmothers lived with us.
goodnight134,In fact they rarely even visited that house.
goodnight134,Over the years people who visited my old, red house FREQUENTLY reported seeing an elderly lady sitting in the rocking chair in my sister’s bedroom.
goodnight134,They innocently assumed that this was a real person and probably a relative of mine.
goodnight134,My friends were mystified when I’d lead them right back up stairs and prove that there was in fact, no one in that room.
goodnight134,Eventually my mom sold the house.
goodnight134,I grew up.
goodnight134,I started a family of my own.
goodnight134,I still thought of the spirits that inhibited my old house from time to time, but only the ones that really scared me.
goodnight134,One day I was having a talk with my daughter.
goodnight134,She’s very driven to the paranormal.
goodnight134,I was trying to encourage her not to mess with dangerous spirits.
goodnight134,Our conversation led us to talking about guardian angels.
goodnight134,“Did you know that I can see your guardian angel?” She confided in me.
goodnight134,Curious, I pressed her to give me a description of my “angel”.
goodnight134,What my daughter said shocked me.
goodnight134,“She’s old.
goodnight134,She has very grey hair and it’s pulled back into a bun, but she has fly-a-ways on top of her forehead.
goodnight134,She wears a ruffled, ivory, button up blouse, and a long dark skirt.
goodnight134,The outfit is complete with a pair of sturdy, black, pointed, heeled boots.” As my daughter described this so called angel the hair on my arms began to stand up.
goodnight134,I’ve heard this description before ... many years ago when I was a teenager.
goodnight134,“She sits in a rocking chair near a window in a room with blue flowered wallpaper.” Okay, now I’m thoroughly creeped out.
goodnight134,My daughter was describing my sister’s old bedroom to me.
goodnight134,It was a room my daughter has never seen with her own eyes or even in a picture.
goodnight134,“The old lady is sad, but she loves you.” Explained my daughter.
goodnight134,“She’s watched over you since you were born and she tries to keep you safe.” Isn’t that what a guardian angel does?
goodnight134,I thought about me, as an infant and a sweet old lady ghost seeing me, watching me.
goodnight134,I thought about her maternal instincts and what it might have meant for her to be dead, and yet care for a living child.
goodnight134,Senses of love and responsibility never left her, not even in death.
goodnight134,So, here I am, the infant all grown up and I feel proud to say that I have a ghost who watches over me.
goodnight134,
goodnight105,
goodnight105,I got a new book from the library today and it’s written by an author I don’t know.
goodnight105,Usually when I pick a book to cuddle up with I stick to authors I know and enjoy.
goodnight105,Jim Butcher, James Patterson, Dan Brown, Anne Rice, J.K. Rowling, V.C.
goodnight105,Andrews, Stephen King have all written books that I immensely enjoyed.
goodnight105,The book I’m about to start is “When We Were God’s” a novel of Cleopatra by Colin Falcorner.
goodnight105,I’m a big history buff especially when it comes to ancient Egypt, Sumeria, and Mesopotamia.
goodnight105,I love how the rulers became gods and goddesses forever engrained with time and sand.
goodnight105,I’m not sure if this book will be an accurate depiction of the authentic life of Cleopatra, but I have a healthy imagination to be entertained regardless.
goodnight105,What I’d really love to find is books about the Anunnaki gods and specifically, Inanna.
goodnight105,My soul pulls so strongly to her.
goodnight105,It’s beyond fascination.
goodnight105,It’s obsession.
goodnight105,I love how her traits resemble me.
goodnight105,I love her lust for war or love.
goodnight105,My local library doesn’t carry any pagan books never mind the anything referencing the ancient anunnaki dynasty.
goodnight105,It’s a shame.
goodnight105,I’ll need to use amazon and google if I want that type of literature.
goodnight105,I suppose I’ll make do reading about Cleopatra.
goodnight105,A good story can inspire dreams larger than the stars.
goodnight105,
goodnight135,
goodnight135,I’ve got the winter blues.
goodnight135,Life lately has been limited to work, running errands, watching a lil’ bit of tv, and house work.
goodnight135,My high points have been going out to eat with The Man at our favourite restaurant (well, my favourite restaurant) and the new kitty scape we purchased for the boys.
goodnight135,That’s been it.
goodnight135,Kind of lame and not exactly living it up if you ask me.
goodnight135,I’ve got Saturday off and The Man usually has Saturdays off.
goodnight135,The weather has been fairly mild lately.
goodnight135,I didn’t even need a jacket today.
goodnight135,The gears in my head are moving, forming a plan...
goodnight135,Last Summer we took the chillens on an Epic Hike Day.
goodnight135,We hiked 2 mountains and made it 1/2 way up a third when Deedee decided she’d had enough.
goodnight135,We never made it to the top of Table Rock Mountain.
goodnight135,I heard the view is breath taking.
goodnight135,I for one, was in love with the trail we were on.
goodnight135,The picture in this blog is from Blue Moutain Ridge and in the distance is Table Rock.
goodnight135,All fall and this winter The Man and I keep talking about going back and finishing what we started.
goodnight135,Picnic lunch on the top of a Mountain, taking in the view – sounds like my ideal date!
goodnight135,I plan on bringing the idea up tomorrow when I see The Man.
goodnight135,He’s been feeling sick lately and can’t seem to shake off some sort of bug.
goodnight135,He may not be up for it.
goodnight135,I’m crossing my fingers.
goodnight135,I need a day spent with my feet on the Earth, surrounded by trees and sky.
goodnight135,I need the exercise.
goodnight135,I need this moment!
goodnight135,It’s just the thing to cure my winter blues.
goodnight135,
goodnight82,
goodnight82,This week is all highs.
goodnight82,I’m up above the clouds in disbelief that my life has taken such a huge turn for the better.
goodnight82,I use to think suicide was beginning to look like an attractive option.
goodnight82,Now I’m glad I that I refused to give up.
goodnight82,I didn’t feel like I had anything to live for, but I didn’t want my kids growing up thinking that I didn’t love and care about them enough to try living for just a bit more.
goodnight82,I’ve been working out almost every day.
goodnight82,I’ve taken a shine to Zumba (at home, on my wii).
goodnight82,I hate working out in public.
goodnight82,I’m very stiff and rigid.
goodnight82,I don’t have fluid nor graceful movements.
goodnight82,I rarely gesture.
goodnight82,So while I love dancing and moving my body in motions that feel foreign I am rather self conscious about it.
goodnight82,In private settings I could care less.
goodnight82,I did a few routines last night.
goodnight82,The Man joined me.
goodnight82,It seemed like more of a game to us than a work out.
goodnight82,Afterwards he sat and talked with me a bit.
goodnight82,Long story short he’s concerned about his health and his weight.
goodnight82,He’s worried about diabetes.
goodnight82,It’s in his family.
goodnight82,It’s not a fate he wants.
goodnight82,Luckily he can do something about it.
goodnight82,So the good news is I have an exercise buddy.
goodnight82,We’re in this together.
goodnight82,With our work schedules being crazy and opposing lately we’ve had trouble sharing the family jeep.
goodnight82,I spend about an extra 2 hours of my day driving to and from The Man’s job so that I can get to mine.
goodnight82,Today, we solved the problem.
goodnight82,I am now the proud owner of a Ford Mustang.
goodnight82,It’s not the newest nor the best model there is, but the price was definitely right.
goodnight82,I’m not sure which one of us likes it more.
goodnight82,The best part is: it’s a standard!!!
goodnight82,I love driving stick.
goodnight82,If I ended my life a few bad years ago I would miss being the proud owner of a mustang.
goodnight82,I’d miss getting the chance to make things right with the man.
goodnight82,I’d miss the kittens who I’d never own and yet give me so much love.
goodnight82,I’d miss watching my kids grow.
goodnight82,Time is given.
goodnight82,You can’t buy it.
goodnight82,You can give it up, but then you’re the one missing out. 
goodnight82,

goodnight121,Dreams are supposed to be the windows to our subconscious.
goodnight121,If you pay attention dreams can reveal our inner fears, hearts desires, and even details of our lives we failed to see with our eyes open.
goodnight121,Dreams can mean so many things.
goodnight121,All too often some one tells me about their dreams, their nightmares.
goodnight121,Some dreams are scary, others profound, and some make no sense what so ever.
goodnight121,Regardless, I can’t help but feel left out.
goodnight121,I’ve been told that everyone who sleeps dreams.
goodnight121,That isn’t a very useful fact.
goodnight121,Whether I dream or not I almost ALWAYS can not remember them.
goodnight121,After I slip away from awareness, it just goes black.
goodnight121,One second I am awake, then asleep, next thing I know I am groggy, but waking up.
goodnight121,I am 33 and I can recall only about 20 dreams or so and those were very prophetic and symbolic.
goodnight121,When I meditate, sometimes I have a lucid dream, but that’s a very different thing.
goodnight121,A strange thing does happen though... sometimes while I’m groggy I willl get a vibe about some one I know or even a place.
goodnight121,An example would be that sometimes while still groggy I’ll think of a co worker and an emotion attached to them.
goodnight121,Then when I see that person they will tell me they dreamed of me and the tone and type of the dream will be whatever emotion I felt.
goodnight121,Its unnerving,  but by this point I am use to it and I control it.
goodnight121,The rabbit hole gets deeper.
goodnight121,I am in full control of these dream visits.
goodnight121,If I focus on a person or a place, that person will tell me I visited them in a dream that felt extremely real.
goodnight121,If I visit a location after I’ve dreamt it I can tell you weird details (like what’s hidden in a dresser drawer if I checked it out in a dream) and I can physically validate these details once a wake.
goodnight121,Its weird, I know...
goodnight121,So I may not dream in a typical sense, but my brain is definitely up to something while I sleep.

goodnight120,From high above the water crashes down
goodnight120,Dampened skin, hearts pounding heavy
goodnight120,In the dark cave, behind the water fall
goodnight120,Your arms wrapped my frame
goodnight120,It’s time say good bye
goodnight120,This is the only way
goodnight120,One soul has been claimed
goodnight120,And I choose it to be you
goodnight120,The moment is at hand
goodnight120,In the dark Ba swings his sword
goodnight120,You never saw it coming
goodnight120,I kiss at gash as the blood runs down
goodnight120,You were my ultimate sacrifice 
goodnight120,I stare into your eyes
goodnight120,In that moment as you take your last breath
goodnight120,You have a revelation as the light shines bright, calling you home
goodnight120,Love and Hate is the same
goodnight120,In the eyes of Inanna
goodnight120, 
goodnight120,For centuries I have paid the price for your death
goodnight120,Always missing you, always longing
goodnight120,Never able to trust again
goodnight120,I hear your call in the wind
goodnight120,I taste your kisses in the rain
goodnight120,I can’t find you my love
goodnight120,I’m paying the price
goodnight120,In this immortality, I am reborn
goodnight120,Only to be haunted by the ghost of you
goodnight120,

goodnight133,Last night J’s cousin messaged him to comment on how Deedee seems like such a “dark” kid and how her FB page is filled with posts about emo / goth bands and creepy pasta stuff.
goodnight133,“What the heck happened to her?!?
goodnight133,!”
goodnight133,Rash judgement of Deedee drives me up a wall.
goodnight133,Yes, she likes to wear dark colors.
goodnight133,Yes, she listens to emo music.
goodnight133,Yes, she’s a horror movie buff.
goodnight133,What happened?
goodnight133,Nothing.
goodnight133,She’s 14.
goodnight133,If said cousin had paid any attention to Deedee while we lived closer he might have noticed she has Asperger’s Syndrome.
goodnight133,She separates herself from her peers.
goodnight133,When she takes up a hobby, she’s obsessive about it.
goodnight133,She has ALWAYS been this way.
goodnight133,When she was 10, I took her and my other 2 babies to Disney World.
goodnight133,Deedee tried to pack all of her stuff by herself.
goodnight133,When I double checked her suitcase, I discovered that every article of clothing she packed was BLACK!
goodnight133,I’ve tried to get her to wear a more colorful wardrobe and she clearly doesn’t want to.
goodnight133,She’s 14.
goodnight133,It’s a phase.
goodnight133,When she stopped listening to Katie Perry and Selena Gomez and pronounced her love for “My Chemical Romance”, I listened to her new favorite bands.
goodnight133,My opinion: The lyrics are inspiring.
goodnight133,I can see how an isolated teenager can relate to it.
goodnight133,There’s really nothing demonic about it.
goodnight133,Her favorite movies are “The Nightmare Before Christmas”, “Coraline”, and “Corpse Bride”.
goodnight133,Not to mention she likes an assortment of seemingly strange Japanese anime movies.
goodnight133,Her favorite store at the mall is “Hot Topic”.
goodnight133,*sigh*
goodnight133,At her school the other kids listen to rap.
goodnight133,They like Wayne and Drake.
goodnight133,They listen to songs that talk about getting drunk, gang violence, and sex.
goodnight133,This type of music, to me, encourages violence, underage drinking, and serious skank activity.
goodnight133,Some of her classmates drink, smoke, smoke pot.
goodnight133,Most of them aren’t virgins.
goodnight133,Deedee comes from a generation that is growing up too fast for ones so young.
goodnight133,Deedee doesn’t drink.
goodnight133,She doesn’t smoke.
goodnight133,The closet thing to sex she’s experienced is that she kissed a boy ONCE.
goodnight133,She chooses her friends wisely.
goodnight133,Honestly, if said cousin thinks she’s “too emo” than what would he prefer?
goodnight133,She’s too old for barbies and my little pony.
goodnight133,Would he feel better if she was posting selfies while scantily dressed, trying to attract the wrong kind of attention?
goodnight133,Would he prefer a regressed 14 year old posting pictures of kittens and unicorns?
goodnight133,For crying out loud, she’s growing up.
goodnight133,She’s rearranging her looks, she’s discovering her identity.
goodnight133,I also feel the need to mention who is said cousin to judge her?
goodnight133,He’s not a dad.
goodnight133,Supposedly he has a kid, who he has never met nor supported for a single second in the child’s life.
goodnight133,Said cousin is a bar scene alcoholic who picks up the “easiest” or drunkest girls and takes them home for a one nighter.
goodnight133,He’s never been a role model to any child in his extended family.
goodnight133,He should worry about himself instead of a 14 year old autism spectrum girl who is very passionate about her hobbies.
goodnight133,If you ask me, Deedee is a rare gem.
goodnight133,She reads H.P.
goodnight133,Lovecraft and manga.
goodnight133,She likes going to the library.
goodnight133,She’s insistent that she needs to be in ALL honors classes next year when she goes to high school.
goodnight133,She’s adamant about going to college.
goodnight133,I never have to tell her to do her homework.
goodnight133,I rarely ever have to correct her.
goodnight133,She listens to her teachers, her dad, and me.
goodnight133,She’s never had a detention.
goodnight133,She’s such a GREAT kid it’s to the point where she’s earned the right to wear what she wants (band tee shirts and black skinny jeans).
goodnight133,She’s earned the right to listen to what she wants.
goodnight133,I can’t force her to be some one she’s not just because she’s a “dark” kid.
goodnight133,And if she appears a little dark and stormy, so what?
goodnight133,She’s been betrayed by adults that she trusted.
goodnight133,Said cousin use to encourage her dad to drink and be more involved in his metal band than his kids (not that case anymore – her father’s 1st priority is his offspring).
goodnight133,Funny how he doesn’t see how his own hand set this course for her.
goodnight133,Deedee hadn’t had the most stable, supportive, peachy upbringing despite how deeply loved she is.
goodnight133,My point is, she’s amazing.
goodnight133,If said cousin actually bothered to TALK to her before he judged her by her FB shares, maybe he’d realize that her darkness is an excuse to push her peers away due to her crippling social anxiety and that underneath the music and clothes, Deedee has a loving, beautiful soul.
goodnight133,
goodnight102,
goodnight102,I proudly live in a household void of cable tv.
goodnight102,We do watch movies, have video game systems, and have some technology available at our finger tips.
goodnight102,I like to binge watch various tv series when I feel the longing to be lazy.
goodnight102,My last great thriller was Vikings.
goodnight102,Currently I’ve taken a shine to American Horror Story – Freak Show.
goodnight102,Admittedly, it isn’t for everyone.
goodnight102,I have a gravitational pull towards the macabre so it right up my alley.
goodnight102,I’ve watched most of the other seasons.
goodnight102,I’ve seen all of Murder House, most of Asylum, and some of Coven.
goodnight102,Thoroughly engrossed in Freak Show, making connections to the past seasons, I started having some thoughts.
goodnight102,Our history, as humans (not limited any one country) has dark secrets tucked away.
goodnight102,We use to incarcerate people who suffered from mental health issues, mental retardation, physical deformities, or even people who had the unfortunate luck to be poverty stricken.
goodnight102,Was it right?
goodnight102,Morally, on an individual basis absolutely not.
goodnight102,Did it help society?
goodnight102,Shockingly the answer might be maybe.
goodnight102,I started to make all sorts of connections.
goodnight102,It’s a daily habit for me to read the news daily.
goodnight102,My heart shatters while I read stories of violent crimes, rising drug use, a revolving door prison system, child abuse, and so on.
goodnight102,It seems like once a day I come across an article where some one committed a murder suicide and selfishly ended some one else’s life in addition to their own.
goodnight102,Are we expressing this hideous behavior on a larger scale than back in the days of out casting and institutionalizing?
goodnight102,It’s that where most of this stems from?
goodnight102,Are we experiencing a huge deficit of treating mental health?
goodnight102,We can’t go back to the old system even if my theory is correct.
goodnight102,To dump our special needs and disabled neighbors and family members off like a bag of trash is cruel as it gets.
goodnight102,Nobody deserves that fate, especially those who are innocent.
goodnight102,I don’t have the answers on how to help society’s growing number of sociopaths and deviants, but throwing out the whole bushel of perfectly good apples just because there was one rotten one comes at too high of a cause.
goodnight102,I don’t even think these people were locked away for the purpose of protecting the greater good or to get the help and care that they needed.
goodnight102,Sadly I think they were subjected to imprisonment so we would be more of a cookie cutter society.
goodnight102,We could go on with our lives, pretending they didnt exist.
goodnight102,It’s a sad part of our history.
goodnight102, 
goodnight102,
goodnight137,
goodnight137,I’ve read so many other people’s journals and I can literally feel their sorrow, anxiety, anger, emptiness, etc.
goodnight137,It’s a weird experience.
goodnight137,Then again, I’m weird.
goodnight137,This week at work has been hectic.
goodnight137,I make it through my shifts with ease though.
goodnight137,Ever since I experienced my latest awakening, I’ve been more in tune with the others around me.
goodnight137,I don’t take slights personally.
goodnight137,I accept and appropriate constructive criticism and try to gain from it.
goodnight137,I’m even able to give my co-workers a glimpse at big boss they never noticed.
goodnight137,He isn’t bad, I told them.
goodnight137,He’s stressed and pressured.
goodnight137,He goes about things in an “angry panicked” manner, but he means well.
goodnight137,A thought I’ve been having lately is related to telepathy.
goodnight137,I wonder how many people experience this and do not realize that they indeed are picking up on some one else’s emotions and thoughts – all without words.
goodnight137,In a sense if more people had this extra sense, humanity would eventually begin to a resemble a collective hive colony like ants or bees.
goodnight137,What would that do in regards to violent world conflicts?
goodnight137,Religious genocide?
goodnight137,Territorial disputes?
goodnight137,I’m sure not every problem would simply evaporate if humans could think as one collective unit, but I think globally we would have more harmony in our lives.
goodnight137,We would care more for each other.
goodnight137,We would work as the ultimate team.
goodnight137,We’d have the same goals.
goodnight137,With those thoughts in mind, if we did indeed share a collective conscious would we be superior to those who do not (as in most people alive today)?
goodnight137,What would be some of the downfalls?
goodnight137,Surely loss of individually would be at stake, but to me the pro’s outweigh the cons.
goodnight137,I’ve heard “reports” (and I mean report loosely) that alien civilizations communicate through telepathy and their society uses a collective conscious.
goodnight137,Is that why they “seem” more advanced than us?
goodnight137,So those are my thoughts tonight.
goodnight137,My phone (and internet) will be off from 12 am today straight through Monday.
goodnight137,I could refill, but I rather stick to my budget schedule.
goodnight137,I haven’t checked the cycle, but tonight it sure seems like it’s a full moon.
goodnight137,Guests were at their worst.
goodnight137,Screaming, swearing, making a fuss – they didn’t treat us like we’re humans too and we matter.
goodnight137,There is nothing wrong with standing up, being strong, speaking your mind, and such.
goodnight137,However, just remember to treat every one as an equal.
goodnight137,NO ONE is more important than anyone else.
goodnight137,We all matter.
goodnight137,Every life that lives and breaths matters.
goodnight137,Good night 
goodnight137,
goodnight96,
goodnight96,I’m in love... yet again.
goodnight96,I’m also slowly becoming a crazy cat lady.
goodnight96,You know what?
goodnight96,I don’t care.
goodnight96,Sure one more cat means more food, more liter, and more cleaning.
goodnight96,To me the reward exceeds all of this.
goodnight96,I should promise myself right here, right now that we have enough fur babies in this house.
goodnight96,Okay here goes.
goodnight96,I proclaim that this sweet guy is the LAST kitten I’m adopting... for now.
goodnight96,If tragedy strikes one or the kids move out with their cats only then may I get another.
goodnight96,I can not wait.
goodnight96,Little Ben is only two weeks old and just opened his eyes.
goodnight96,It’ll be another 4 – 6 weeks before I can bring him home.
goodnight96,I have a thing about making sure my pets were given adequate time with their mother.
goodnight96,Wean them too soon and you may get a fur baby with a less than desirable disposition.
goodnight96,Since I have kids it’s important that we do all we can to ensure a happy, confident kitty.
goodnight96,This morning the concept of getting another cat was the furthest thing from my mind... than I went to work.
goodnight96,My sweet co-worker and I were talking about cats and she mentioned how her cat just had kittens.
goodnight96,I saw a picture and well I’m sucker for teensy paws.
goodnight96,There was one and only one obstacle that stood in the way.
goodnight96,My loving partner would surely try to bring me softly back to reality.
goodnight96,So I waged war.
goodnight96,I sent him a picture of Ben and asked “Can I have him?”.
goodnight96,The response was music to my ears.
goodnight96,“I just can’t say no to you”.
goodnight96,As much as The Man probably meant that, what I think he really meant was “I can’t say no to teeny lil’ paws.”
goodnight96,
goodnight109,
goodnight109,I am always where I am supposed to be.
goodnight109,That may not be where I think I should be.
goodnight109,It also may not be where you think I should be.
goodnight109,Despite all odds, my location is always perfect.
goodnight109,Do you know why that is?
goodnight109,I do.
goodnight109,It’s destiny.
goodnight109,Not all souls who wander are lost.
goodnight109,The Gaelic saying applies to me.
goodnight109,My soul is that of an eager adventurer always in search of something new to see.
goodnight109,My eyes take in the sights as if I were a plant soaking in the dew.
goodnight109,I prefer forest to beach, beach to city, but any place is as good as any to wander.
goodnight109,I drive by ransacked, abandoned dwellings and I wonder “what’s the story”?
goodnight109,I can feel the presence of the past.
goodnight109,Every place has its own mood.
goodnight109,I love the smell of sun beams through windows.
goodnight109,I love the smell of water running over smoothed rocks.
goodnight109,My senses are easily contented.
goodnight109,When I was 14 or so my mother and I drove from Massachusetts to New Jersey.
goodnight109,On the returning trip home, the map flew out the window (this was the age before GPS and cell phones).
goodnight109,My mother panicked.
goodnight109,To her being lost is like a death sentence.
goodnight109,It’s a source of anxiety.
goodnight109,To me, it’s simply a matter of refocusing on which way to go.
goodnight109,The Earth is only so big after all.
goodnight109,What’s the matter with getting a little side tracked.
goodnight109,I don’t remember how I did it exactly, but I picked highways that felt right.
goodnight109,I hadn’t traveled that route ever before, but using my stellar internal compass I navigated us home.
goodnight109,My mother was grateful and stunned.
goodnight109,So where ever I may go, I am never really lost because at that exact moment I’m exactly where I need to be. 
goodnight109,
