saturday morning skate at the lake front in Chicago.
It was 26 degrees but sunny.
I just had to go out with my skate on.
It seems like my body reacts automatically when I see the sun without clouds lately.
Did a short 5 miles to Belmont harbor and coming back to my place.
Finished laundry n just had an early lunch myself.
No plans till 8 PM.
Iâ€™m just gonna enjoy the free time myself at home!
Happy Saturday everyone!
