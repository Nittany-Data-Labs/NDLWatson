So I’m on vacation now!
I took couple days off already but this is the first time that I get away from Chicago for couple of days.
I will be leaving tomorrow to San Francisco and will be back on Sunday morning.
Trying to get things pack up now.
Oh yeah, I wanted to go Mark’s show tonight but ended up couldn’t making it cause of picking up John and moving stuffs.
Gotta wait for the laundry to be done and pack somethings up.
Don’t have to rush cause I will have plenty of time tmw before the flight.
I felt like I have been going though tough time myself by no reason lately and I’m finally getting better now.
Hopefully this vacation will end whatever depression feeling I have left little.
Anyways, I will enjoy the rest of the night by excitement of traveling tomorrow!
Goodnight everyone
