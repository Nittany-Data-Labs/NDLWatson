Some reason I feel like I’m lost... and I don’t really like this feeling.
Everything is same.
Work, work out, driving back to home, skating at lake trail and sitting at my computer.
Every single day, I try to move on to get to the better position and nothing’s really happening for an year.
Maybe I’m not trying hard enough?
or I’m just so unlucky that I wasn’t at the right place at the right time?
I don’t know.
Sometimes, I get confused what I’m pursuing for and today I feel exactly like that.
It’s 9:30 PM, trying to write things down that I have in my mind right now.
I will spend rest of my night for doing freelance work.
Hope you don’t feel like me today.
