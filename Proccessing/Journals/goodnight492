I felt really tired today when I drive back to home from work.
So I went to bed early around 9PM then my mom called me after an hour.
I picked up the phone n said I’m sleeping n tried to go back to sleep but I couldn’t.
It’s already been 2 hours and I’m fully awake right now lol.
I want to go back to sleep.
Have a doctors appointment tmw morning n work from 2pm to 6pm.
I feel like it’s weekend already.
