Church n BBQ.
That’s about it.
Expecting to see someone at church but she didn’t show up today.
Went to friends place for BBQ after church.
Burgers n pork with some beer.
Watching tv n talking with friends.
Very relaxing n fun Sunday for me.
Now it’s time for me to go to bed.
It’s 11:12 pm here in chicago.
Goodnight guys!
