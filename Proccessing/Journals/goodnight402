I’m little depressed cause of this.
We had awesome weather today so I went out to bike when I got home but had to come back without accomplish my goal cause my knee pain was getting worse  Got back home and feeling depressed about it.
Just gonna eat good and rest for today and tomorrow.
Hopefully it gets better on Friday for Road Rave.
And yeah I should probably go see a doctor next months cause I just changed my primary doctor to close to me and it’s gonna be affected on June/1.
Well at least the weather was great!
