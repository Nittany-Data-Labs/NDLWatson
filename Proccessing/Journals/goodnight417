I have this runny nose from last night and today I feel sick.
I haven’t got a cold for over an year and seems like I finally got one.
So now I’m deeply regretting the thing that I did yesterday.
I decided to go on a skate with a short sleeve t-shirt in 30 something degrees weather.
I skated down to Lincoln park from where I leave and it took about an hour to get there.
Right after I got to my friend place, I started having runny nose.
yeah it was a bad decision.
Hopefully, I get better by tomorrow so I can go to work.
I didn’t do much today since I don’t feel good.
church in the morning and had a lunch with my friends and still looking for an apartment.
I found a one right next to my place that does have good price but the owner did not pick up the phone.
He probably have someone already but I will call again tomorrow to make sure.
Hope all of you had a good weekend and don’t get sick!
