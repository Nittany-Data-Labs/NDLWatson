My daily pattern got totally messed up!
Last night, I couldn’t go to sleep till 3 in the morning.
Tonight I went to sleep at 9 pm and got up at 3 am then couldn’t go back to sleep.
I expected to have a long n deep sleep tonight not waking up right in the middle of it  Although I got up early, I do not feel tired at all.
I guess I am gonna have very early breakfast today!
BTW it’s been crazy freezing here in Chicago.
I do not want to get out of my apartment.
