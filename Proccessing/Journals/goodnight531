Do not really have anything to write.
work from 10 AM to 6 PM.
there was a huge accident on I-90 in the morning which resulted blocking whole out bounce lane and got me late for work for 10 mins.
work out on lunch break, stopped by at John’s place to pick up some furniture and had dinner with him.
he told me he is going to move out in two days that was surprising since I thought he’s never gonna move out of that apartment.
Back to home around 9 just organizing things.
