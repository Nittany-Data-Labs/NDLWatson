I went out tonight n came back to home at 1:30am on my bed trying to write journal for tonight.
I feel good not cause of I went out tonight cause my sister receieved macbook I sent on last Saturday and she’s really happy anout it which makes me feel good.
Hope she uses it well to find things that she wants to do for her life.
I’m not close to where I wanna be yeah not even close but now I feel like im getting there and I won’t give up.
Goodnight everyone!
