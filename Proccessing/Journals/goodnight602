I have been taking some nice pics of my neighborhood n sharing these with you one by one:) I had really long day today.
Woke up bad hang over n sleepy all day at work n right now.
Had too much alcohols last night but it was so fun.
Skating, beach, concert, mojito, Mexican food, red wine, bars, n the girl from the bar.
Pretty girl with a huge tatto on her shoulder.
I was too drunk to ask her number or name and now I’m deeply regreting for drinking way too much cause it was one of the few situations I had in my life that girl came up to me first.
Maybe I will meet her again if she’s the one for me.
Now I’m going sleep.
Pic the reservoir where I met that girl
