I slept a lot this weekend.
yesterday I woke up 5:30 pm and  today I woke up at 3:30 pm.
I probably slept over 24 hours on Saturday and Sunday.
I must be really tired from inline skating on Friday night.
We skated around city for 13 miles and I was exhausted for half off the time and my body still sore from it.
I had dinner with John and my friend yesterday and going out little bit to the neighborhood bar.
missed church today cause of the long sleep and now trying to find out what I want to eat for dinner tonight.
hope you all have great weekend.
