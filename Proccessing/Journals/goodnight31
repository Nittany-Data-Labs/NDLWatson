We were supposed to get snow, but didn’t.
Some people are glad and others are disappointed.
Especially school children, of course.
I think I’m glad.
I need to get some groceries in today.
Yesterday was a wonderful day for me.
I heard a sermon on TV that made me know we are each chosen by God and blessed and highly favored.
As I listened to the preacher, I could feel his words as truth inside me.
Of course he talked a half hour and I tried to sum it up in a sentence, but what I want you to remember is the beautiful truth that Jesus loves you and is with you in whatever trials you may be going through.
He will bring you through to a better place.
Talk to Him.
Journal to Him.
Believe in Him and feel the glimmer of joy in a new relationship which will bring you only good.
He is the Friend your heart craves.
If you already know Him and belong to Him, know that He loves you tenderly and watchfully, and you can cast all your cares on Him because He cares for you.
Happy day to all!
