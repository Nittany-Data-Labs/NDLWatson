Ahhhh I forgot to sign up for electricity when I moved into here new apartment a month ago n they disconnected electricity for my apartment.
it’s so dark can’t do anything n they said it will probably take couple days to get it back.
Well I guess I get couple more days of vacation to just sleep all night long  my cell phone doesn’t have enough battery either have to make it short!
Good night everyone
