I started to learn JavaScript all over again today.
I have used it for years but I never really had a chance to study from beginning.
As I use more and more on real life projects, I noticed more that I need to understand basics of it.
Understanding the basics will help me build better products in the future.
This will take some time and effort.
I just need to stay focus and finish it as soon as possible.
Since I have some knowledge, I’m planing to go through entire thing in this week for the site I found.
Many other things will come after.
Let’s do this O!
