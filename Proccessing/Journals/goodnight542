So my tripod finally arrived and noticed it shipped from Indiana which would take no more than couple hours  to drive there from Chicago.
Some how it took almost a week but the good thing is that I finally have it and I can start my thing going.
I set up all the light sources I have for the video as it shown on the picture.
As I expected, it was not enough lights to get the quality I want.
Now Iâ€™m debating myself on either spending couple hundred dollars for photography kit or just find way to work around it.
The biggest problem I have now is the shadow come from poor lighting set up.
I have noticed before when I worked on 3D stuffs that lighting set up is very important and difficult and now I get the same feeling again.
I will do some more research to see if I can save couple hundred dollars for things that I probably going to use once.
Anyways, I feel relieved for finally getting started again on my project.
