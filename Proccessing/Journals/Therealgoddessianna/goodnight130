Hi there!
Can you answer a quick question for me?
Just use the first thought that comes to mind and please don’t Google it.
Here’s the question: What color is the opposite of red?
So simply I know and yet, it was the meat and potatoes of a serious debate at my house tonight.
My husband thinks it’s one color and I think it’s a different one.
I’m curious as to who’s answer is the more popular choice.
I won’t say who said what though (maybe you’d be bias if you had prior knowledge of our answers)
Thanks for your help in this
