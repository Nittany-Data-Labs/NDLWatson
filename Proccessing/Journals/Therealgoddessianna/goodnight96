I’m in love... yet again.
I’m also slowly becoming a crazy cat lady.
You know what?
I don’t care.
Sure one more cat means more food, more liter, and more cleaning.
To me the reward exceeds all of this.
I should promise myself right here, right now that we have enough fur babies in this house.
Okay here goes.
I proclaim that this sweet guy is the LAST kitten I’m adopting... for now.
If tragedy strikes one or the kids move out with their cats only then may I get another.
I can not wait.
Little Ben is only two weeks old and just opened his eyes.
It’ll be another 4 – 6 weeks before I can bring him home.
I have a thing about making sure my pets were given adequate time with their mother.
Wean them too soon and you may get a fur baby with a less than desirable disposition.
Since I have kids it’s important that we do all we can to ensure a happy, confident kitty.
This morning the concept of getting another cat was the furthest thing from my mind... than I went to work.
My sweet co-worker and I were talking about cats and she mentioned how her cat just had kittens.
I saw a picture and well I’m sucker for teensy paws.
There was one and only one obstacle that stood in the way.
My loving partner would surely try to bring me softly back to reality.
So I waged war.
I sent him a picture of Ben and asked “Can I have him?”.
The response was music to my ears.
“I just can’t say no to you”.
As much as The Man probably meant that, what I think he really meant was “I can’t say no to teeny lil’ paws.”
