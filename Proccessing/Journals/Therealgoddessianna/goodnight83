It’s just behind my eyes
The power to control you
Such a little effort
To have you wrapped around my fingers
Your beating heart is in my hands
I could squeeze the life right out of you
Turn you into my broken toy
Come play with the succubus
I’ll take every thing you’ve got
And you’ll still come back to me
I’m your obsession 
I’m your addiction
With one small look
I’ll leave you mesmerized 
You’re drawn in before you know
It’s too late for you to run away
I’ll infest your mind like a disease
I’ll find you in your dreams
Kneel before me in submission
Cause I’ll do as I please
I warned you before I got started
And now, you’re mine
You belong to me
