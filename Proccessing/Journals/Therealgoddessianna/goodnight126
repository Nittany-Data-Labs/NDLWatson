It’s time I buckle down and remember the distinct separation of church and state.
Well, in my case it is more of a matter personal life verse work relationships.
A comment flew off the tongue of a co-worker, a highly inappropriate comment.
I suppose I should divulge its content, but I’m reluctant.
I’ve spent 24 hours going back and forth between stewing over it and actively ignoring it.
Everyone will judge so the only judgement that holds water is my own.
However, I’d rather not have rumors fly around about me and my name dragged through the mud.
This is, after all, a huge reason I chose to move so far a way in order to give myself a fresh start.
So in this case the proper course of action is to be a busy bee, keep to myself, and hold my tongue.
Certainly there is no need in this instance for confrontation or retaliation.
To move past this I must hold my head high and show my worth.
Respect is earned.
Time for me to buckle down, ignore personal slights, work hard, and speak with love for others.
Positivity can and shall be contagious.

On the home front... I’ve caught The Man’s cold.
Yuck.
At least I have an excuse to be lazy for a day or two.
