How often these days can I sit back, reflect, and think “life is good”?
Frequently.
The funny thing is I mean it.
My life is great.
No, I am not famous (not that I want to be anyways).
No, I’m not rich (not big into material stuff anyways).
I have everything I need though.
Today was especially great.
Yes, I’m not into material things all that much, but sometimes a shopping trip is fun.
I can’t deny it.
The Man took me to the mall today and let me go nuts.
Literally, I could get what ever I want.
I secretly suspect there was no set limit on today’s free for all because The Man knows I can’t stand wasting money.
He knew I’d get a few new outfits maybe a pair of shoes and that’d be it.
He was right.
I love my new clothes!!!
And my new sneakers are so freaking comfortable.
I had to wear my work sneakers all the time because my $8 pair of “what are those” family dollar wannbe converse were pretty much so ripped they were talking.
I have a sneaker fetish.
I love those sporty shoes.
I especially love big, puffy boy high types.
I love Air Jordans... like walking on a cloud.
I also really like Osiris’s, but they are a little hard to come by in the South.
I have really small feet so I can either get woman’s sneakers (bleh... so NOT me) or I can fit into boy’s sizes.
Yup.
I buy kids shoes.
I have to admit, The Man telling me today was only about me really felt nice deep inside.
I kept trying to get clothes he needs too, but he said not today.
He even carried every single bag around the mall.
Chivalry is not dead ladies!
So today I’m a spoiled brat.
It’s okay for just one day... right?
