I am here for another day.
My soul dances underneath the moon, growing stronger from the stars.
I am such a fortunate, lucky woman.
I may not have everything I want and need, but I have everything one truly needs.
I have my health, I have my family, I have a warm dry roof over my head, and I have a full belly.
Bad days come and go.
They are fleeting like a thunderstorm.
I have used the pain and agony that I have truly suffered.
I used the torment to forge myself into something strong, quick, filled with hope and love.
I hope that I can be an example.
I hope I can be regarded as kind.
I hope my words will be heard as wise.
My soul is older than a time I can even imagine.
I do not know the full purpose of me rebirth.
Is it a gift or a punishment?
I suppose since as long as I live and breath, the reason doesnâ€™t matter.
The important thing is that I am.
