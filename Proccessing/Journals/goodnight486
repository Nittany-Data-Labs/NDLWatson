Sharing pics that I took today.
It was a day of hang over.
I was hanging out with my neighbor at her apartment last night.
We been drinking beer n started to take shots.
Next thing I remember after taking couple shots was me waking up on my bed lol so I had really horrible hang over all day.
Despite having that hang over, I did lot of things today.
Snowboading for like 10 min at the lake, seafood buffet with john, shopping at old orchard mall, then check out new grocery market.
