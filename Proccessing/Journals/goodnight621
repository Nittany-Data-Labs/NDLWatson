I just noticed that I been missing lots of days for writing journal.
only see 3 entries in May lol.
this is horrible.
I wanted to write every day journal in 2013 and apparently it’s impossible to do that now.
one of another typical day for me.
went to graphic designer meeting after work.
got some good information about freelancing since I want to get some freelance work, I guess it was good decision to go there.
been working on new theme ever since I got home from that meeting and now I’b about to go to sleep.
added recent public journal entries and public images on the main page.
will work on style tmw.
goodnight everyone!
