This is the bible phrases that my Dad tells me all the time and I like the most.
I don’t remember when but when I was young, I heard someone saying about the goals in life.
Set your goals as high as you can possible think.
Ever since that, I been having big goals that might not even possible to achieve.
However, one thing I know is that having those big goals get me going and I never give up till I get those.
Every time I read this phrase, makes me think of the goals in my life.
And trying to believe that I’m constantly asking, searching and knock everyday.
