First time when I moved here to Chicago from Korea in 2006, I met some friends who also came here to learn English.
We became good friends and spent about 2 years in Chicago hanging out pretty much every weekends together.
It’s been over 8 years now and most of them already left here went back to Korea for the good reason or they just had to.
Today, I had to say goodbye to the very last one who’s been here with me till today.
I took a day off today to spend time with him and dropped him off at airport.
Feels little weird that makes me feel like I’m the only one left here.
Well I just wish them the best luck in Korea and one day we maybe get together again and talk about everything.
I’m glad tho that everyone is moving forward for their life and career.
And many other good friends here in Chicago around me who probably won’t move to any other country 
So I’m starting week by tomorrow and hope it won’t get cold as today lol
Goodnight!
