So since Anton got me back into iOS developer program, I decided to update iOS app for GoodnightJournal.com and I just uploaded new app to iTunes connect which will be reviewed by Apple people and will go on App Store eventually.
Iâ€™m using the new app to write this journal now and hoping it will work as I interned  Yes, I got lazy to test it properly before I submit it lol 
I just got a notification of completion for the process.
I have to go update all the art assets.
I feel very productive for doing this on Saturday night after a long day of skating 
Hope this will get more people to write journal here.
