I started at my new job today and honestly, is very exhausting because I had to clean at least 20-30 rooms!
The lady who is training me seem a bit “mean” , I guess she didn’t like me much.
Other than that, its not a bad start at housekeeping job.
I only need to learn how to clean the rooms properly and I’m good to go :).
