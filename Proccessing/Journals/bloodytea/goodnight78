   I realize that most people tell about them selves in there first entry how ever my hands have a mind of there own and seemed to have other plans.
So here we go about ME ME ME!!!!!!
Most people would say I am eccentric.
I would have to agree with this statement being that I do live in a small 8×9 foot bubble under the sea with of course my 24 foot pet dragon which can at times be dreadfully annoying with his awful snoring habits and all but hey I can complain much he is the one who has to put up with my horrid morning breath!
Oh and then of course I have two wild heathens who follow me around everywhere I go named Sambo and Woeden .
Such helpless little savages.
They get up dreadfully early and don’t stop nagging with there high pitched shrieks until I at last allow them to lick the earwax from the previous days Qtips.
so Eccentric..?
Yes I find this quit fitting.
My favorite is yellow.
In fact I like yellow so much I have even taken it upon my self to harvest 26 rittleboppers from the earth and name them all Yellow.
In case you don’t know what a rittlebopper is here is the definition,
Rittleopper- A small animal like plant that sorta looks like a tiny thingordoodle on the third day of the 9 settings sun and lives for exactly 891 years and 3 days while crying tears of joy the whole time in a pitch too low for the human ear to hear and only eats green lima beans every 3erd sunday.
I also Like to play the piano.
I once composed a song so great I got the honor of playing for the queen of wombonboo and her 72 cousins.
Afterwards we all had tea.
So there is a little about me if you would like to know anything else please just ask
