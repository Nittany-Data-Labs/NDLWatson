   As our fight went down to the river still we never prayed.
Now its come down to this fist to face I wont let you win.
He wont let me win.
Baby you have broke my heart and ate me whole.
now where do we go from here when we both don’t go.
down in the river where we never pray.
I love with all my might.
That will never charge.
You try and say I am the one that’s real however now I know this is only a gas light.
I love you so much I will hurt you and hurt my self.
If we both cant win I will not give the submission only runs to the point of dream and now I have seen where the is no light.
that is not a dream but stupid little thing bigger than the both of us.
Now I cant think to speak how long you waited for this day.
I bet you think that thing will go your way.
You are always wrong.
You tried to run away I held you down with my own arms this your force broke me again and the I ran away where you found tied to the tub pulling me away.
It was only a joke when you cried out in pain.
selfish deeds and using me will only bread more shit.
How can you not see how your always wrong.
I wont let you go even when you run Ill be a punching bag before you can leave the scene.
Don’t you lie and say you wont love me.
Don’t you be a fool again to say your leaving me only to return again.
Don’t you think I have learned by now these are only words and you are to go I’m right behind you as you pretend your running for me you only just fast enough for me to trip on your shoe.
no you will never go.
if I drown you drown too.
so what if I am dark so what if I am crazy.
ill eat you whole you will live inside of me.
I got my fork and iv got my knife ready to jump inside my self after you.
you chase me away to grasp my hair and drag me back.
I push you out until you agree to go and then board up your walls you are never leaving me again.
