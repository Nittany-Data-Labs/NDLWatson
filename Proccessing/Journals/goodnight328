This week is going by very fast.
It’s already Thursday and I’m not quite sure what I have done this week.
Probably nothing productive on my expectation lol.
I just want to write down things I have done this week.
On Monday, I went to Lissie’s show in Lincoln Hall with Jad.
I did not even know who she was and not a big fan of folk music either.
However, I wanted to how it is and check out the place.
Plus Jad got me a ticket so why not.
We ended up having good time.
It was actually fun.
Tuesday, I skated to Katja’s after work for the BBQ on her rooftop.
It has an amazing view of Chicago and I was with people I love!
We had a great time with food, drink and talk.
It’s so sad that she has to leave.
On Wednesday and Thursday, I went out skating for 12-13miles.
It was a perfect weather for skating and I really enjoyed it.
J joined me tonight’s skate and we also stopped by at full moon fire jam for little bit.
Tomorrow, I will be at work at 9 and get off at 3 PM for the Critical Mass.
It will be a lot of fun.
Listening Bigbang’s music after not listening Korean pops for awhile.
It kind of makes me miss Korea but yeah I still love to live here.
Well... I need to success first.
Sharing a pic from Tuesday night from Katja’s rooftop.
