I’m so sorry for the inconvenience.
Obviously,  there was an error when we move to the new server from Godday and they did not even know why and how to fix it.
since I don’t have enough knowledge of server side stuffs, I took more time to fix the issue with image upload.
now it’s GOOD TO USE!
I tested several times to see everything works okay but please let me know if you see something does not work properly.
I apologize again for the inconvenience and have good journaling!
