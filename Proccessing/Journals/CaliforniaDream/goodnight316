It’s been a very long time that I sit down on my desktop.
Ever since I moved to big room, I did not really bother to use desktop and I don’t know why.
Anyways, just wanna to see it still works okay and seems like it does.
Seems like I have a lot going on lately.
I kind of need to write them down to prioritize things.
– Need to find a roommate
– Update on wp user frontend
– WP theme project Simtiful
– Book and hotel and get a plan for NY trip in August
– othoo.com direction
– Find a usage on my new tablet lol (Find a way to use voice recorder on multi-window.
So I can practice pronunciation)
– Keep looking for that thing I have been always looking 
These are the things I need to get done or constantly work on.
Well, nothing seems harder than travel to the moon or walk on the water.
Today, I listened a podcast had a Black Obama as a guest and just wanted to point out that he kept personal journals for about 7 or 10?
years.
He said that sometime he read through them and found himself not much different than 20 years ago which is interesting to me.
I have been keeping journals from 2006(I believe lol) but have not really read though my old journals and don’t really feel like read them at this moment.
Maybe later when I feel like go back and read them, I can share how I feel about it.
It’s 9:58 PM here in Chicago.
I will probably go to sleep early today.
goodnight everyone!
