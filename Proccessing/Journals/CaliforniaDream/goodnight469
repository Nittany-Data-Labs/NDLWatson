Dear Diary,
I had one of those typical day except for the freezing weather.
Work, work out on lunch break then home sitting at my computer like any other nights.
about to work on the project that I have been working on for couple weeks.
I think I found the information I need for that project so I gotta test it out.
Had too much food for dinner cause I feel uncomfortable to be sitting down on my chair lol.
I really have to reduce the amount of food that I am eating especially  for dinner.
