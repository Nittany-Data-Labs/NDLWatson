I have been thinking about this quite a lot lately.
well I think about that all the time ever since I gave up my goal after graduation.
I guess my life has been kind of settled down in a boring way.
working full time make money for living go out on weekend so on so on... yeah I’m definitely missing something and I believe that is the goal that I need to pursue.
always saying and deciding to sit down and organize things, write down things I want in my future but I never really spent time to do all that.
these days I’m just spending time on this site beside going out spending money.
I want to get the goals like a year ago.
I want to be crazy for something.
I want to move forward.
this is not the place for me to settle down.
remember your journey is not even close to the end yet.
you still have long way to go and I am going to enjoy it.
