The sun was still up when I got off the work which made me want to do something rather than just go work out at gym n go home sitting at computer rest of the night.
So I called up my friends n went to dinner with them at Indian restaurant.
Had couple different dishes n we all shared together.
The frontear chicken was so good we all loved it.
The Garlic bread was good to forgot how to call it “nan” maybe.
Anyways, it’s good time with my friends n good food!
Feel tired already.
