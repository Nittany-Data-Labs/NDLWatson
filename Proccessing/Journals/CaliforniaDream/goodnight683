started working on another website today!
I actually bought a domain 2 months ago but could not have time to work on that so far.
Today, I spent all my day working on that site hoping to get it done by today.
it’s over midnight rignt now and I still have to fix so many things on that site.
lol much more work than I expected.
I guess, it needs at least a week to open beta service.
I couldn’t even watch the walking dead tonight cause of this  and now I need to go to sleep for work tmw.
well at least I did something productive over the weekend
