Having a headache again.
The cold medicine I took last night did not work out I guess.
I know some of you donâ€™t have to go to work today but not me and I have to leave in 10 mins.
Since I can still walk around, I will go to work.
Hopefully it goes away soon.
I hate being sick and I not gonna get sick.
