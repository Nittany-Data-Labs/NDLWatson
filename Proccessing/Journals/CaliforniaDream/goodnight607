No choice 
I have to get a new car.
fortunately my parents are willing to help me out with down payment but they don’t want me to spend tons of money on my car.
I was not even in to nice cars anyways but I was thinking about getting Prius.
However, since they want me to spend less money on the car, I’m more leaning towards to Prius C. All my friends are trying to convince me not to get Prius with very important reason that no girls gonna date a guy who drives Prius especial on my age.
that actually almost convinced me.
It was really hard fact to ignore.
However, I found myself an answer that those girls are not the one for me.
I like hybrid car cause it saves environment and I believe someday I will meet a girl who has same opinion with me.
