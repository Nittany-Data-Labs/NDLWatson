the weather gets warmer and sunny which makes me want to go somewhere for  vacation instead of working.
working on WP theme at work and it’s coming out really good.
I am really excited about that hope I will be able to get more time to work on that.
came home with john to work on out online shopping mall site.
get payment system setup n now I have to integrate it to the site and fix some issues well that’s gonna take long time.
removed pinkback / trackback on this site to prevent spams.
feel like I’m getting lazy and lazy.
I have to get back to work.
I really to need to sit down and write down things that I need to do.
it’s all in my head but need to be organized in order.
hope everyone had good Monday!
