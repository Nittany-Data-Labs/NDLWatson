I failed  couldn’t keep it up everyday.
It seems to me, it’s almost impossible.
However, I still write a journal whenever I have time n still agree with that writing something everyday is good.
Writing journal comes to me like leaving a traces to look back n gives me time to think about that, makes me come up with better plans for tmw.
I will finally have time to work on this site probably next week n I can’t wait!!
