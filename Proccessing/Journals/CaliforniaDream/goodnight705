Kind of expected little bit last night that I felt like I’m gonna get a cold and when I woke up today, I definitely felt that I’m getting sick.
cough and horrible runny nose.
especially the runny nose drives me crazy.
had over 1 liter of tea and hoping to get better soon.
I really wish to get better when I wake up tomorrow.
I don’t wanna get sick cause I don’t really have anyone to take care of me at this moment.
