It’s was snowing last night but its been sunny all day still cold little bit but nice enough to go out for walk.
The weather is always an issue here.
I had very peaceful day today n now I’m finally getting bored.
Want to meet someone n have a beer with good food.
Now I need to find someone to do that n it’s gonna be tough since I don’t have many friends
