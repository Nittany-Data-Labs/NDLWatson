Woke up hours ago but still on my bed with my laptop and being really lazy ðŸ˜€ I know that I have to do laundry and go gym for swimming but I donâ€™t feel like moving at all lol.
So Iâ€™m just spending time on my bed for couple hours and it feels really good.
Just surfing internet and texting with my friends.
So today, I have only have a meeting at night with dinner and rest of day is free.
I will probably clean my apartment after the gym and look for apartment to move in.
Itâ€™s kind of hard to find one that I like with the price range that I can afford.
Hopefully I will find one soon.
Have a good weekend everyone!
