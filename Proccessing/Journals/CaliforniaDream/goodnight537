feel so bad for skipping the church cause I could not wake up.
That’s why I don’t want to go out on Saturday night but I kind of had to last night.
Woke up about one and a half hour ago, still on my bed working on my cover letter that will go on my portfolio website.
Playing around with words is fun and hard at the same time.
Trying to make it sound better but not sure if it’s right way to say it or not.
No other plans for today.
just gonna do laundry and cleaning.
watch the walking dead at night.
how’s your Sunday going?
