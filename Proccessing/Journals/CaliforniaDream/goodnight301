Probably the craziest weather in this year so far.
It was hailing in the morning that turned into snow then rain.
I don’t know what’s going on but I know it’s pretty nasty out there... Well cause of that we got to leave early at work.
Traffic wasn’t that bad than I expected.
Actually, it is nice to be at home early sometime so I can have some relax time 
Can’t believe it’s already the last week of 2015.
Time indeed flies.
It feel like just couple months ago when it starting to getting warm and got excited to skating after the winter of 2014 – 2015.
Just 3 more days to work this week and it will be a long weekend again.
Maybe I should start thinking about the things I want to wrap up before 2016 comes.
Hope all of you had a great Monday 
BTW, this picture is not Chicago.
It’s a picture of New York city.
