new name for the site that I have been working on lately.
hope it works out.
anyways, today I was very busy at work by designing 4 page PDF packet all day.
I could not even take a lunch break but I liked it cause I felt achievement and also time went by fast.
drove an hour to get back to home.
went to run at lake right after I got home.
running makes me feel much better and energetic.
wrote journal for a week then spending time on my computer as usual.
