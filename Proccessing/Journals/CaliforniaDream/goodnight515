As we get more traffics and members on the site, the amount of spam posts has increase significantly.
On Oct/30/2013 I decided to set up anti-spam system on the site that suppose to block spammer to post inappropriate content that irritates other users on the site.
However, the system turned out to be blocking some real members to login to the site.
I apologize to all the members who had experience trouble logging in to the site.
As today, I removed anti-spam system completely on the site and you wonâ€™t have trouble to login to the site.
I apologize again for the inconvenience and happy journaring!
