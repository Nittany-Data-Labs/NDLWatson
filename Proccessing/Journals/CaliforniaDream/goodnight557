sorry for inconvenience.
I have to re set up the site, in order to make site work properly as before.
Godaddy really messed up this site so bad and now I have to fix it  I really hate to say but there might be some data loose.
I will try as hard as I can to keep all the data we have.
anyways, hope to see you all soon!
