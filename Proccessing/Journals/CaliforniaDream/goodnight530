It’s 12:33 AM about to go to sleep.
Just writing things i did today on my smartphone.
Same rroutine as usual.
Work, gym, got off at 6.
Then went to john’s place to help him out moving to the new place.
Since he has so many stuff, we have to do it again on tmw night.
Back home just went throught the sites till now.
My eyes are hurting gotta go sleep.
Goodnight!
