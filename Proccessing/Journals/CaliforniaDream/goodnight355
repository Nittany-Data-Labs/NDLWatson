Because itâ€™s been a while for me to write journal here.
Yes, I have been very lazy lately.
Well, it seems like I have been saying that for every single time I write journal for past couple months.
I feel shame on me for that lol.
Not much going on with my life just same things as usual.
Trying to spend more time on new project that I started months ago and it is finally coming out okay.
It still needs more work but I think it is good to share now with you guys here at goodnightjournal.
So my new project was creating a site for online shopping websites, where you can find online shops, share online shops you like and review them to help others to find ones they need.
As I said, there are many more things have to be done but you are more than welcome to come by and check out the site.
It is www.othoo.com
Feel free to leave any comments, questions or concerns.
Thank you!
have a great weekend!
