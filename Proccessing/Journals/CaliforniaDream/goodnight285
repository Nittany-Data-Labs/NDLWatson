My cover image has nothing to do with my journal.
It just looks so pretty wanted to have it as cover image  My Tuesday was okay just another days in a week.
Work and work out on my lunch break.
Weather’s got little warmer but still below 32.
I got couple things that I want to do before I go to bed today that I couldn’t do it cause I went out with Miao and Jose last night at Michael’s Pizzeria.
We had 4 pitchers and a 14 inch pizza.
Drank little more that I was expecting but it was a great time!
So glad to have them as friends along with other awesome people!
So things I gotta do tonight is, catching up with my paper journals, get rough layout for the skating event (Suggestions from Gerard) and start working on t-shirt design.
Skating event seems to be going pretty good so far but I know there will be a lot more we have to take care as it goes on.
So trying to anticipate as much as we can now!
I guess not much going on other than that.
Also searching for ways to do marketing for this site.
Sent out couple emails to writers on big sites today.
Hopefully I get some response from them.
I would like more people to find awesomeness of keeping journals and hoping GoodnightJournal.com will help them doing it.
Goodnight everyone!
