It’s been kind of busy Sunday.
Church in the morning and picnic in the afternoon with skating group that I love  The weather was beautiful and there were bunch of new people showed up for the first time.
We had really good time at the lake till almost 6 PM.
Now I’m trying to wrap up the week.
just finished writing journals for week and doing laundry.
Feel like I have a lot going on.
I really need to sit down and organize stuffs.
I will have to write it down by priority and do things one by one.
I guess my new freelance work will be the first thing that I have to finish up this week which I’m already working on it.
then spend some time with my personal projects that I have neglecting for a while.
I feel really guilty for that.
Things are still really mess in my head right now and I will try to organize them after I put my laundry to the dryer lol
I was talking a picture above and my friend took a picture of me taking that picture.
that’s what’s going on with pictures
