It’s Wednesday night already lol I moved to new apartment yesterday n had to take a day off for it.
So I feel like time flies this week.
So I got almost everything unpacked now but still no internet.
I talked to the girl next door and she’s willing to share it with us but we haven’t got a password yet.
Maybe tmw we pay half of the price she pays and get access for it.
It drives me crazy that I don’t have access to internet with my computers.
Hopefully this issue gets solved tmw.
Beside moving to new apartment, nothing really going on.
Work, gym and home exactly the same days.
The weather got cold again and doesn’t seem like getting any warmer.
So I couldn’t go out for out door activity at all this week.
Well since I don’t have internet(beside my phone), I will just go to sleep now.
