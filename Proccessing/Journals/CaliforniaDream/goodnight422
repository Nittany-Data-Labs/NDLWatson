Woke up around 8am and craving porkchop for some reason with grape lol.
So I went ro grocery market got porkchop and grape.
I was confidence that I could cook porkchop really good as my friend cooked for me couple days ago cause I still have all the spices she picked up.
So I tried do the same as she did and it turned out ok visually but the taste was not the same.
I must missed something or put something else it doesn’t need.
I should have payed for attention when she cooked it.
Well it doesn’t tastes bad though.
We are having a beautiful sunny day here in chicago.
I will go out to lake for skating later for sure.
Today, I habe to finish up for the UI freelance stuff and ask for the price and take care of some of my websites.
Since I have couple other personal projects to keep up.
I don’t know what people usually do on easter weekend but I will just gonna have peaceful weekend like last night.
Happy easter!
The picture above is the one my friend made and the one below is the one I made today.
It tastes better than it looks!
