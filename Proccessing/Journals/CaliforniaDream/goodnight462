Well it’s been about 3 weeks or almost a month that I have been working on this project.
I still putting all my free time on this.
I was really frustrated for past week about the one technical thing that I failed to get a solution but tonight I made some improvement that possibly solve that problem eventually.
Looking back this week, I did not do much just working and my personal project.
Thinking about going bible study and volunteer work but I don’t know if I’m gonna make it.
For now I just want to get this project done.
I know there are gonna be more problems to solve but I will just take it step by step till I get what I want.
Goodnight everyone.
