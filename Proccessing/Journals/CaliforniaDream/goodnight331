It’s Tuesday already.
10:07 PM in my living room writing a journal for today.
The weather got chilly little bit today but sunny.
I had one of those typical days work, home and 30 mins of work out on lunch  break.
My knee still hurts from the running on Saturday morning so I couldn’t do anything after work although I wanted to go out for skating.
Maybe it will get better in couple days so I can go run again this coming weekend.
Not much going on lately which makes me feel like I’m not trying hard enough to achieve my goals.
Well... I just want to be lazy for now and yes it’s been a long time that I have been feeling like that.
Maybe when my knee gets better I will turn around lol
I have to wake up early tomorrow before 7AM for possible opportunities.
I have been messing these up lately but I decided to take that as progress.
I already missed couple chances cause of lack of preparation isn’t that tell you anything O?
