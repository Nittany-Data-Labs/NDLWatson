Nothing special.
Just another Money that I work and did not really go anything after that.
Work out on lunch break as usual but couldn’t go out for skating or running cause of the weather.
The thing is that it didn’t actually rain in Chicago but it seemed like it will be rain soon for like all day.
Weather forecast said the same thing which made me stay at home.
I don’t like this sneaky weather.
Instead of going out, I spent time working on the UI project that pretty much takes up all my free time for weeks.
I need to finish this project soon and move on to other ones.
Just little bit of polishing up has left.
Had a late dinner myself and trying to see what to do for rest of the night.
It’s 10:50 PM watching Jimmy kimmel while I’m writing this.
