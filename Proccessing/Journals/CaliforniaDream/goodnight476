Itâ€™s already been an year of lunching GoodNightJournal on Jan/1/2013.
Started this site for myself to write something everyday and after an year we got over 8,000 members on the site.
I am glad that GoodNightJournal can be part of the memories of people who write online journals here.
I am so excited to see and share more stories here in 2014!
