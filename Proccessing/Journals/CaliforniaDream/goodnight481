And they r beautiful.
Especially the one with bluish lights.
I have been thinking a lot about the new place which will take me where I want to be I believe.
I need better title to move forward n I will keep trying till I get that n move up step by step.
It’s getting crazy cold here after the crazy snow.
They’re saying that it’s gonna be record breaking cold next week.
Good weekend everyone!
