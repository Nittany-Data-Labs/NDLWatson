I tend to get depressed little bit but on Sunday night by no reason.
It just happens whenever I stay home on Sunday night like today.
Well I watched some movies n had some drinks myself n now I’m tired enough to go to sleep.
I don’t know y I get depressed on Sunday night.
I should be or want to be excited for the beginning of new week like when I was in Cali.
