We had a beautiful weather today here in Chicago it almost went up to 60 degrees.
By the time when I got home at 6:30 PM it was 55 degrees and I wanted to go run by the lake so bad since I saw all those people running around city on the way back home.
I changed to gym clothes and went out right away as soon as I got home.
Ran right to the lake and did run for about 5 miles.
I did exactly same route that I used to in last Summer.
There were lot of people running at the lake telling me the spring is coming.
I felt really good right now after taking a shower from running.
I can’t believe that I have forgotten about the this feeling for like 6 months.
It’s probably gonna get cold again tomorrow and snowing on Wednesday but I will see if I can go out and run.
Man I love running and I’m rally glad that I will be able to do it everyday here very soon.
