And this time, the screen went off... I believe the phone is working but I can’t see or use anything on the phone cause the screen went dark  It’s been about 3 to 4 months when I fixed my screen.
I don’t think I’m going to spend couple hundred dollars again to fix my phone.
It’s seems to be better off with new phone since I wanted to move back to iPhone.
I just need some time to think about it before I make purchase.
I have been spending lots of money lately and have some things coming that I need to spend money even more.
So I just need to plan this out.
Well it sucks
