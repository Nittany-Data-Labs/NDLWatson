Got up at 7:30AM quick shower and breakfast then work till 6. doing pretty much same things over and over again.
Today, I had dinner with my friends.
He prepared everything with his girl friend and I just brought a box of beer.
It was very heavy dinner but I loved the BBQ pork.
back home around 9PM worked on my personal project for little bit and writing a diary.
well thatâ€™s pretty much it.
