3days of weekend began!
waiting for this so bad for whole week.
waiting my friends to come over to my apartment then we are gonna go out to the bar in my neighborhood.
the weather was crazy here in Chicago.
it was over 90 degrees pretty much all day then storm came with hail and very heavy rain.
anyways, you all have great weekend!
