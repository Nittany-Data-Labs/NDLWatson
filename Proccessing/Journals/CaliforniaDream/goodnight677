Dedicated Friday night to GoodNightJournal  added a function that u can upload multiple images in an entry.
I’m sharing my 3D work with you!
hope u like it.
I spent lots of time on these 3D works.
it is really time consuming but  I was willing to do that cause I believed that is the way I should go for.
However, now I’m doing something different for living and I really need that at this point.
I guess what i’m trying to say is life is so unexpected and unpredictable.
