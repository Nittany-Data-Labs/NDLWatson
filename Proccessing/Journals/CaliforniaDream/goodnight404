I eat when I get frustrated like today I ended up at the buffet restaurant eating my ass off lol.
It actually wasn’t a big deal.
I have been having that for years now.
However, every time when I get rejected for better opportunity that I want, I get frustrated little bit.
I just need to do something to get over it so I eat.
The good thing is that I already got over and moving on to other opportunities.
Hopefully one day, I will get what I want 
The weather this week has been kind of horrible.
It’s got cold again and raining/cloudy all day.
It sucks cause I can’t go out to lake for skating or running.
I get a feeling that I’m gonna gain some weights this week.
About to start my second part of the day.
I got one project to finish up and couple emails to send out to help out someone who wants to make website like this.
I guess that’s pretty much it for tonight.
I don’t know if you see it or not but just you know my journal is kind of messy always lol
