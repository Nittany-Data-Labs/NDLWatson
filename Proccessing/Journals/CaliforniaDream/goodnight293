It’s been on and off for couple years now.
I haven’t really smoked in summer time and just got back to smoking again lately even since the weather got cold.
Last weekend, I hit the peak that I smoked a pack of cigarette on 3 days.
Although, it was holiday weekend, that was way too much and now I’m trying to cut it back.
I just had a dinner and am really craving for a cigarette now!
I might give up and just go to the grocery market across the street and get a pack.
However, I want to try as hard as I can to see how far I can make this go on.
It’s much easier in summer time that I can just go out for skating and I forget about cigarette lol.
Anyways, the first day of work in 2016 was just okay as last year.
Very calm and comfortable.
Work out on lunch break as usual and got off at 6.
Stopped by at grocery market around work before I head back to home.
Cooked chicken for dinner and writing a journal now.
It’s almost 9 PM.
not sure what I want to do for rest of the night...
