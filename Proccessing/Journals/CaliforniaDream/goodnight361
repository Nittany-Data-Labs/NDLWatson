I just got back home from dentist office cause I pulled out last two wisdom teeth today.
I had a huge issue with my bottom two wisdom teeth years ago which I removed back then.
Ones were on the top were making any problems beside being annoying and today I finally got rid of it.
My mouse is still numbed lol just wanted to write it down about this.
It’s Saturday morning 11:10 AM.
Don’t really have any plans for rest of the day.
will see what comes up!
Happy weekend everyone!
