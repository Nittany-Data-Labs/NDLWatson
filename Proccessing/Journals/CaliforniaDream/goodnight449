I spent the laziest Sunday in like 2 months.
I have been lazy from last night when I decided not to go to the party at my friend place.
Since then, I just stayed at my apartment and did not really do anything but sleeping and eating lol.
Despite I went to bed earlier than usual last night, I woke up really late today and even skipped the church.
Some reason I just did not wanna do anything but being lazy.
So I did that all day long.
Woke up late, took a nap and spent most of the day on my bed and couch.
Now itâ€™s 11:21 and trying to be little bit productive by writing a journal for a day.
Although I have been lazy all day with no motivation, I felt like 90% recharged and I wanna feel like 100% recharged when I wake up tomorrow morning.
Hope you had great weekend!
goodnight!
