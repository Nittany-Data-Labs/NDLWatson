Didn’t have good day at work.
Well nothing happended, I just felt like I didn’t get enough opportunities to be creative n do something that really metters to the company.
I am ready n can do whatever it needs to get done but I don’t even get a chance to show what I can do.
Every time I try it just disappeared in the middle of the chain.
I really want to do things that matters n I will.
Yes I often think like this when I have no projects going on.
I guess I just have to be busy all the time.
