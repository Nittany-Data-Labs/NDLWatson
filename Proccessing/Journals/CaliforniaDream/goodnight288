2016 St Patrick’s day with my favorite people.
It was a great time like the last year.
I had a such a great time with all of my friends in Chicago form 9 AM to midnight.
I’m so glad that I met all these people here and get to spend time with them.
It really means a lot to me.
It’s been raining all day today.
Little bit of hangover from yesterday and rain totally tied me up in my apartment till the walking dead dinner.
Some thought about the situation.
I just couldn’t stop thinking about it.
Nothing is firm yet.
I have to see how it goes tmw.
I feel the expectations and little bit of fear.
Well can’t really say anything now but things will be clear by tomorrow night.
Just do my best and see what I can get!
Hope all of u had a great weekend.
Goodnight
