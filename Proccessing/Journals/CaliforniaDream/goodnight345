I feel like I live with a full of expectations everyday.
It does not mean I just expect something.
I expect something that I have been putting my time for, something I have been trying for.
It feels kind of like waiting for the test result that I took yesterday.
Full of expectation gets me going but sometime gets me little frustrated when I donâ€™t get the result I want.
Maybe it is just my life that I try something to get what I want and waiting with expectations.
What expectations you have on your daily life?
