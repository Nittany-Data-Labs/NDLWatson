Just talked my mom and grand mom in Korea.
My grand mom had a surgery couple days ago and sheâ€™s finally going back to home from the hospital.
She does not sounds very good when I talked her on the phone.
Though she is definitely recovering from the surgery.
Hope it wonâ€™t be to hard for her to get back to normal.
My mom also did a lot to take care of her.
Although Iâ€™m not there to see but I can tell.
Maybe itâ€™s about time for me to go see them again.
Had a pretty decent day today.
Nothing special to write about.
Iâ€™m just so glad itâ€™s Thursday night  Seems like this weekend will be busy.
Going snowboarding and catching up with friends!
will be fun.
9:07 PM here in Chicago.
Feel already sleepy and I think I need some extra time for sleeping.
Since I stayed up late playing around with backing up this site.
Itâ€™s good that I finally figured out what to do and saw it worked!
Things are gonna go smooth now on ðŸ˜‰
Goodnight everyone!
