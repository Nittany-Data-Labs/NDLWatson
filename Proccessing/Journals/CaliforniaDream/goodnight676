It’s snowing so bad all day n it’s still snowing.
Looks like its gonna be nasty all week yeah welcome back to chicago.
I forgot to bring my gym bag In the morning as a result, couldn’t go work out instead met John at my place and had meeting for about 4 hours.
Tried to get a layout for what we want to do.
I think we got pretty much everything laid out for now.
After the meeting, things became way more clear.
Now we know exactly what we have to do.
Good!
I guess today I go to sleep before midnight.
