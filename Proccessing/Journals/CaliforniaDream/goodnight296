Just got back from going out with my friends and a girl I think I like.
Well you know everyone wants all their things to go as they wanted but in reality, it really does not.
I think it is time for me to move on.
The girl I like does not seems to be on the same page as me and I don’t want to push her to do anything.
She already has a lot to take care of her own.
Sometimes you have to make a decision that you don’t really want but I do understand that it is inevitable sometimes.
At the end, I want her to be happy and so do I.
To do that, I’m going back to what it was before when I saw her for the first time when I only see her As friend and I believe it’s better for everybody around me.
I’m so glad tho that I met all these friends who I can depend on including her.
I’m drunk but this won’t be change.
What a night!
What happened in Paris was horrible.. My deepest condolences for everyone who lost their loved ones...
