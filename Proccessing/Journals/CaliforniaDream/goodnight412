Just wanted to say that cause Iâ€™m very happy for getting my internet back.
We are using the one from next door and it works very poorly last night.
I did some research and found a device that extend wifi range.
Woke up, went out to Staple to get it(they even had $10 off on that device lol).
Just installed it and works very good.
Nice!
