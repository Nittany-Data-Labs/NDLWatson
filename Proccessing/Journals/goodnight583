Still up just wrapped up working on new platform.
It’s getting close to the end yay!
I had lot of progress in past couple day.
So excited about it  Today was cloudy Friday here in Chicago.
I had heavy dinner with my cousin at seafood buffet restaurant.
I ate 3 dishes of crab all by myself lol.
watched the wolverine after that good movie but not worth to spent $12 for 3D.
It would be perfectly fine without 3D.
back home around midnight worked on new platform till now almost 3 in the morning.
since I don’t go to work tmw I’m not afraid to go to bed late.
