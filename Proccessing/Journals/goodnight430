I always have questions for myself that why am I always thinking too much, Why can’t I just be satisfied for what I have right now and want more and more.
I keep asking myself but still don’t know why.
It’s just me and I just gotta keep going for what I want.
For doing that, I tend to be over stressed out.
Sometimes, it’s frustrating when you don’t get what you try for.
Despite knowing that, I just have to keep going and I know I never give up.
It will probably like this for a long time.
What do you think?
is this good way to live your life?
