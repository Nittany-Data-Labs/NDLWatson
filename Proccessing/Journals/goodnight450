My diary for Wednesday.
I haven’t had enough sleep last night n night before.
I had very hard time waking up in the morning and that’s why I want to go bed now at 9:49pm right after wrting this.
Well, not that much to write.
I just had regular day.
Work and gym on my lunch break then home.
The weather was beautiful though.
It was sunny and kind of warm(as long as it’s not freezing).
I cut my finger little bit last night when I cut onion while I was making dinner.
I got bandage on it all day and it was little annoying for me to do things I usually do like wash my hand lol.
Keep craving for something delicious to eat but I don’t know what.
Maybe it’s time for the seafood buffet.
Anyways, I’m going sleep goodnight!
