kind of wish this last forever  had great time, did many things ,now it’s time to go back to work.
Today, I had time to clean up my apartment, doing laundry, paying bills, and organizing stuffs.
So I guess I’m ready to go back to the real life.
I had late dinner with John at restaurant called Light House.
I tried really hard not to eat a lot but I failed again now I’m having a problem with digesting all that food lol
