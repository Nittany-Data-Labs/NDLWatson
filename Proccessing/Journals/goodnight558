I was so tired all day yesterday from the hang over on Friday night.
I went out with my cousin at Wrigley field and got really wasted don’t even remember the last part of the night when apparently some stupid things happened including the drunk text that does not make sense at all.
have random pic taken in my phone that I have no idea about.
anyways crazy night and I had to go volunteer work next day on Saturday.
spent all day there exhausted back home around 9 PM and passed out.
today, I feel way better.
went to church in the morning and now I’m back home enjoying the rainy weather by working on the site.
WP update today.
and just backing up files that I do regularly.
