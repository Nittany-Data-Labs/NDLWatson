I haven’t had enough sleep this week from Monday cause of working on the new project.
I was up till like 2 AM and 4 AM 2 days ago.
Tonight, I’m gonna go to sleep early.
I’m really sleepy right now and I have just finished the thing that I planned to do for tonight.
Just for reminder for TMW on my new project.
– edit display custom fields
– backend map data load
– date format and calendar
– Emphasize find function 
I guess that’s enough for tomorrow.
It’s 10:32 PM here right now and I’m ready to sleep after the diary.
It’s going to be below zero Fahrenheit tomorrow.
goodnight people!
