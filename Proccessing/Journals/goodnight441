Finally the weather is getting warmer here.
we are going above the 32 degrees next week.
It will stay there for whole week according to weather forecast.
Can’t wait to see the warm weather and start running again by the lake.
I’m sharing a pic of the place called Jinhae in South Korea that I want to live when I retire someday.
They have Sakura(cherry blossom) festival every year in the spring and it’s really beautiful as you see it in the picture.
I had a long sleep last night that I really needed.
Woke up around 1:30, cleaned up my apartment and trying to see what I want to do for rest of the day.
have a good weekend everyone spring is almost here.
