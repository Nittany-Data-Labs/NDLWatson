      Winters death is near.
Its a beautiful and gloomy day.
Its about to rain I can smell it, one of my favorite scents.
So this morning I have opened all the windows of my home.
As I feel the fresh wind  blowing through the house and the seasons changing I can feel my life changing as  well.
In the last month I have lost 22 lbs then for the last few days I have messed up.
I am going to think of the last few days as just a simple break from my life style and get back on it today.
We all need a break sometimes right?
