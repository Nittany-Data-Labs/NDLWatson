I had very typical day.
Work, work out on my lunch break as usual, and drove right back to home.
Then I decided to go out skate cause I haven’t done it at all this week.
Today, I went down to navy pier so total about 13 miles for hour and a half.
It was fun amd made me feel better.
Don’t know why but skating makes me feel better.
Spent rest of night working on freelance works.
It’s 12:20am already but I don’t really feel sleepy yet.
