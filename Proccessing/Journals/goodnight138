Dear Pb,
I miss you.
Remember all of the silly names I had for you, my bunny bumpkins.
I want you to know that I loved you dearly.
Memories of your buggy brown eyes will forever put a smile on my face.
I love the way you grunted and honked at the vacuum.
Your silly rabbit antics were endless.
I hated washing dishes, but to look down and see you at my feet made those darn dishes bare able.
Some people have teddy bears.
When I watched tv in bed I had you.
I’m sorry I couldn’t take you with me.
I wish with all my heart that I could brought you with us.
I feared such a huge move would have killed you.
Pb, you are a cure for the blues.
When I gave you to Crystal it’s because I knew she’d take good care of you.
What I didn’t foresee was that like I had once, she needed you.
I think of you from time to time.
I hope you still get chances to hop around outside and nibble yummy leaves.
I wish you were here, but I’m so glad that you give some one else all your bunny reasons to smile.
