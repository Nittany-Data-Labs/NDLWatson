It’s snowing again here in Chicago n it’s been accumulated over 5 inches I believe.
I did enjoyed it yesterday when I didn’t have to go to work but today it was kind of pain in the ass to shovel all those snow around my car to go to work.
I wish I’m in ski resort now.
Went to see my dentist today to get cleaning but she refused to do it cause of my cold sore n gave me an orniment for it.
It looks really nasty I really want this to go away asap.
