I’m really glad and excited about the freelance work that I’m working.
It’s doing really well and will hit 500k revenue in less than 4 months.
It got me more excited cause I didn’t really think this is gonna come this soon.
Feel really good about it.
I’m actually working on that project right now and trying to get things done by Saturday.
Hopefully I can make it!
John’s been out of town from Tuesday till Saturday I think and I’m just keep working after the work lol.
However, I can’t complain 
Every time I get busy, I think about the time when I was in Cali and that gets me going.
