Been very busy at working working on PHP stuff.
Time went by fast at work when I get busy like today.
took me over an hour to get home.
The traffic is getting worst everyday drives me crazy lol.
Got out to lake when I got home with new running shoes from John.
It was very  comfortable which made running much easier I guess.
doing laundry and writing down things I did today.
