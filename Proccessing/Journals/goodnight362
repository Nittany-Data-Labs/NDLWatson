4:04 AM in San Francisco, sitting in the hostel with lots of thoughts.
Got up about an hour ago, couldn’t go back to sleep.
just decided to get up and be ready for leaving.
My flight is 8:30 in the morning thinking about leaving soon and just kill some time there.
I don’t know why just have so many unnecessary thoughts in my head which drives me kind of crazy.
just want to empty my head and be peaceful.
Actually the breeze from the window feels really good right now.
Well for now, I just want to get back to home and be relax.
SF was awesome and I had lots of fun but at the same time I felt very tired every time I came back to hostel at the end of the day.
I definitely need some rest now and recharge myself.
yeah just stop thinking about things and be relax...
Just noticed that my username is California Dream and now I’m trying to get out of here California where I always want to be lol funny.
