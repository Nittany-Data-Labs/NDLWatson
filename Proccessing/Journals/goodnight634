She called me today and we talked about 30mins to talk about everything as usual.
I found myself that I actually enjoy a lot to talk with my mom as I get older.
Asked her about North Korea since the media talks about North Korea a lot lately, it bothers me all the time cause my whole family is in South Korea.
However, she said everything is fine over there and people in South Korea don’t really worry about it at all which made me feel relived.
I kind of want my whole family to move here and live with me though, cause I miss them and North Korea still seems very unstable to me.
Lately, the marriage became hot issue for my mom.
every time I talked her over the phone, she never forgot to ask me about girl friend and when I said no, she starts to mentioning about arrangement marriage for the girls that she knows in Korea.
lol I feel little bit of pressure but I really don’t want to rush things up for this issue.
I still believe that I will meet someone someday who makes me want to get married.
well no more thinking about marriage that’s too much for me right now.
I will just go to sleep for tmw since I have to be at work by 9am, I have to wake up an hour early.
