this is not good.
can’t concentrate working on animation now by some reason.
worked on video for over 3 hours and I kept detracting by something.
I don’t know why..
I guess I just gonna wrap it up tonight anyways, I got a lot done today.
Seems like I can get animation done by Wednesday unless I get lazy again then shooting video on Thursday.
Will be done with this by this week and move on to other projects.
feel like a lot going on around me and I just need to be more energetic and optimistic.
I want to be super excited for all that things that I’m gonna do for my future.
